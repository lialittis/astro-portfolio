### [Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks Against LLM Assistants](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/indirect-prompt-injection-attacks-against-llm-assistants.html) - September 03, 2025

<p>Really good <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/invitation-is-all-you-need/home">research</a> on practical attacks against LLM agents.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12175">Invitation Is All You Need! Promptware Attacks Against LLM-Powered Assistants in Production Are Practical and Dangerous</a>&#8221;</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> The growing integration of LLMs into applications has introduced new security risks, notably known as Promptware­&#8212;maliciously engineered prompts designed to manipulate LLMs to compromise the CIA triad of these applications. While prior research warned about a potential shift in the threat landscape for LLM-powered applications, the risk posed by Promptware is frequently perceived as low. In this paper, we investigate the risk Promptware poses to users of Gemini-powered assistants (web application, mobile application, and Google Assistant). We propose a novel Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) framework to assess Promptware risks for end users. Our analysis focuses on a new variant of Promptware called Targeted Promptware Attacks, which leverage indirect prompt injection via common user interactions such as emails, calendar invitations, and shared documents. We demonstrate 14 attack scenarios applied against Gemini-powered assistants across five identified threat classes: Short-term Context Poisoning, Permanent Memory Poisoning, Tool Misuse, Automatic Agent Invocation, and Automatic App Invocation. These attacks highlight both digital and physical consequences, including spamming, phishing, disinformation campaigns, data exfiltration, unapproved user video streaming, and control of home automation devices. We reveal Promptware’s potential for on-device lateral movement, escaping the boundaries of the LLM-powered application, to trigger malicious actions using a device’s applications. Our TARA reveals that 73% of the analyzed threats pose High-Critical risk to end users. We discuss mitigations and reassess the risk (in response to deployed mitigations) and show that the risk could be reduced significantly to Very Low-Medium. We disclosed our findings to Google, which deployed dedicated mitigations...</p></blockquote>

### [1965 Cryptanalysis Training Workbook Released by the NSA](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/1965-cryptanalysis-training-workbook-released-by-the-nsa.html) - September 02, 2025

<p>In the early 1960s, National Security Agency cryptanalyst and cryptanalysis instructor Lambros D. Callimahos coined the term &#8220;Stethoscope&#8221; to describe a diagnostic computer program used to unravel the internal structure of pre-computer ciphertexts. The term appears in the newly declassified September 1965 document <i><a href="https://www.governmentattic.org/59docs/NSAlDCCDAC1965.pdf">Cryptanalytic Diagnosis with the Aid of a Computer</a></i>, which compiled 147 listings from this tool for Callimahos&#8217;s <a href="https://ia601207.us.archive.org/22/items/Legacy_Callimahos-nsa/Legacy_Callimahos.pdf">course</a>, <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/portals/75/documents/news-features/declassified-documents/cryptologic-spectrum/Callimahos_Course.pdf">CA-400: NSA Intensive Study Program in General Cryptanalysis</a>.</p>
<p>The listings in the report are printouts from the Stethoscope program, run on the NSA&#8217;s Bogart computer, showing statistical and structural data extracted from encrypted messages, but the encrypted messages themselves are not included. They were used in NSA training programs to teach analysts how to interpret ciphertext behavior without seeing the original message...</p>
