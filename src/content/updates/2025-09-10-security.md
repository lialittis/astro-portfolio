### [New Cryptanalysis of the Fiat-Shamir Protocol](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/new-cryptanalysis-of-the-fiat-shamir-protocol.html) - September 09, 2025

<p>A couple of months ago, a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/118">new paper</a> demonstrated some new attacks against the Fiat-Shamir transformation. <i>Quanta</i> published a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientists-figure-out-how-to-prove-lies-20250709/">good article</a> that explains the results.</p>
<p>This is a pretty exciting paper from a theoretical perspective, but I don&#8217;t see it leading to any practical real-world cryptanalysis. The fact that there are some weird circumstances that result in Fiat-Shamir insecurities isn&#8217;t new&#8212;many dozens of papers have been published about it since 1986. What this new result does is extend this known problem to slightly less weird (but still highly contrived) situations. But it&#8217;s a completely different matter to extend these sorts of attacks to &#8220;natural&#8221; situations...</p>

⚠️ One click is all it takes.
An engineer spins up an “experimental” AI Agent to test a workflow. A business unit connects to automate reporting. A cloud platform quietly enables a new agent behind the scenes.
Individually, they look harmless. But together, they form an invisible swarm of Shadow AI Agents—operating outside security’s line of sight, tied to identities you don’t even know exist.

### [How Leading CISOs are Getting Budget Approval](https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/how-leading-cisos-are-getting-budget.html) - September 09, 2025

It’s budget season. Once again, security is being questioned, scrutinized, or deprioritized.
If you're a CISO or security leader, you've likely found yourself explaining why your program matters, why a given tool or headcount is essential, and how the next breach is one blind spot away. But these arguments often fall short unless they're framed in a way the board can understand and appreciate.

### [AI in Government](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/ai-in-government.html) - September 08, 2025

<p>Just a few months after Elon Musk&#8217;s retreat from his unofficial role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), we have a clearer picture of his vision of government powered by artificial intelligence, and it has a lot more to do with consolidating power than benefitting the public. Even so, we must not lose sight of the fact that a different administration could wield the same technology to advance a more positive future for AI in government.</p>
<p>To most on the American left, the DOGE end game is a dystopic vision of a government run by machines that benefits an elite few at the expense of the people. It includes AI ...</p>
