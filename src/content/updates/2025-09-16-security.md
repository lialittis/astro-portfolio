### [Supporting Rowhammer research to protect the DRAM ecosystem](http://security.googleblog.com/2025/09/supporting-rowhammer-research-to.html) - September 15, 2025

It is a hardware vulnerability in DRAM where repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows, leading to data corruption. This can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to data, escalate privileges, or cause denial of service. Hardware vendors have deployed various mitigations, such as </span><a href="https://www.jedec.org/category/keywords/ecc"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">ECC</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> and Target Row Refresh (TRR) for DDR5 memory, to mitigate Rowhammer and enhance DRAM reliability. However, the resilience of those mitigations against sophisticated attackers remains an open question.</span></div><div><span id="docs-internal-guid-5af8ad98-7fff-d116-4e18-140704e3f961"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">To address this gap and help the ecosystem with deploying robust defenses, Google has supported academic research and developed test platforms to analyze DDR5 memory. Our effort has led to the discovery of new attacks and a deeper understanding of Rowhammer on the current DRAM modules, helping to forge the way for further, stronger mitigations.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-top: 18pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16pt; font-weight: 400; vertical-align: baseline;">What is Rowhammer?&nbsp;</span></h2><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2678373.2665726"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Rowhammer</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> exploits a vulnerability in DRAM. DRAM cells store data as electrical charges, but these electric charges leak over time, causing data corruption. To prevent data loss, the memory controller periodically refreshes the cells. However, if a cell discharges before the refresh cycle, its stored bit may corrupt. Initially considered a reliability issue, it has been leveraged by security researchers to demonstrate privilege escalation attacks. By repeatedly accessing a memory row, an attacker can cause bit flips in neighboring rows. An adversary can exploit Rowhammer via:</span></p><ol style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Reliably cause bit flips</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> by repeatedly accessing adjacent DRAM rows.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Coerce other applications</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> or the OS into using these vulnerable memory pages.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Target security-sensitive code or data</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;"> to achieve privilege escalation.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Or simply corrupt system’s memory to </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">cause denial of service</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Previous work has repeatedly demonstrated the possibility of such attacks from software [</span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9138944/"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Revisiting rowhammer</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #444746; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">, </span><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9152654/"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Are we susceptible to rowhammer?</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #444746; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">, </span><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2976749.2978406"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Drammer</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #444746; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">,&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity16/technical-sessions/presentation/razavi"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Flip feng shui</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #444746; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">, </span><a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1669"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="background-color: white; color: #1155cc; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Jolt</span></a><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">].

TRR is a common example, which uses a number of counters to track accesses to a small number of rows adjacent to a potential victim row. If the access count for these aggressor rows reaches a certain threshold, the system issues a refresh to the victim row. TRR can be incorporated within the DRAM or in the host CPU.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">However, this mitigation is not foolproof.

Therefore, for an effective mitigation, we have to understand how a determined adversary introduces memory accesses that bypass existing mitigations. Three key information components can help with such an analysis:</span></p><ol style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; padding-inline-start: 48px;"><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">How the improved TRR and in-DRAM ECC work.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">How memory access patterns from software translate into low-level DDR commands.</span></p></li><li dir="ltr" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">(Optionally) How any mitigations (e.g., ECC or TRR) in the host processor work.</span></p></li></ol><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The first step is particularly challenging and involves reverse-engineering the proprietary in-DRAM TRR mechanism, which varies significantly between different manufacturers and device models. This process requires the ability to issue precise DDR commands to DRAM and analyze its responses, which is difficult on an off-the-shelf system. Therefore, specialized test platforms are essential.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The second and third steps involve analyzing the DDR traffic between the host processor and the DRAM. This can be done using an off-the-shelf interposer, a tool that sits between the processor and DRAM. A crucial part of this analysis is understanding how a live system translates software-level memory accesses into the DDR protocol.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 12pt; margin-top: 12pt;"><span face="Arial, sans-serif" style="font-size: 11pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The third step, which involves analyzing host-side mitigations, is sometimes optional.
