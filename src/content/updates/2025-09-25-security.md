### [Accelerating adoption of AI for cybersecurity at DEF CON 33](http://security.googleblog.com/2025/09/accelerating-adoption-of-ai-for.html) - September 24, 2025

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Elie Bursztein and Marianna Tishchenko, Google Privacy, Safety and Security Team</span><div><br /></div><div><span id="docs-internal-guid-8e79da15-7fff-42f1-e9f4-a519ea3c9da7"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">Empowering cyber defenders with AI is critical to tilting the cybersecurity balance back in their favor as they battle cybercriminals&nbsp;and keep users safe. To help accelerate adoption of AI for cybersecurity workflows, we partnered with Airbus at DEF CON 33 to host the <a href="https://defcon.org/html/defcon-33/dc-33-contests.html#orga_41062">GenSec Capture the Flag (CTF)</a>, dedicated to human-AI collaboration in cybersecurity. Our goal was to create a fun, interactive environment, where participants across various skill levels could explore how AI can accelerate their daily cybersecurity workflows.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><br /></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcLA6k65KjQlWcbJXhHHh0UE_mXa1xnbFIHelnyZUL61KoKoGcidbjhziKGf785k2QpNHXGPsji94F9-r0PF-jCvgSf0-PBfV8jk-b2hVxqG1Xh4Lllsz7DS-YYGilXNuZ-LVMJ7wuVJyvS4lLdm0-wmIZCZqFfzPiAXAJ0vZRu3DUTqeVMZlEv4M4cfOV/s4000/genctf-banner-defcon-colors.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="333" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcLA6k65KjQlWcbJXhHHh0UE_mXa1xnbFIHelnyZUL61KoKoGcidbjhziKGf785k2QpNHXGPsji94F9-r0PF-jCvgSf0-PBfV8jk-b2hVxqG1Xh4Lllsz7DS-YYGilXNuZ-LVMJ7wuVJyvS4lLdm0-wmIZCZqFfzPiAXAJ0vZRu3DUTqeVMZlEv4M4cfOV/w444-h333/genctf-banner-defcon-colors.jpg" width="444" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">At GenSec CTF, nearly 500 participants successfully completed introductory challenges, with 23% of participants using AI for cybersecurity for the very first time. An overwhelming 85% of all participants found the event useful for learning how AI can be applied to security workflows. This positive feedback highlights that AI-centric CTFs can play a vital role in speeding up AI education and adoption in the security community.</span><p></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">The CTF also offered a valuable opportunity for the community to use <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/04/google-launches-sec-gemini-v1-new.html">Sec-Gemini</a>, Google’s experimental Cybersecurity AI, as an optional assistant available in the UI alongside major LLMs. And we received great feedback on Sec-Gemini, with 77% of respondents saying that they had found Sec-Gemini either “very helpful” or “extremely helpful” in assisting them with solving the challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">We want to thank the DEF CON community for the enthusiastic participation and for making this inaugural event a resounding success. The community feedback during the event has been invaluable for understanding how to improve Sec-Gemini, and we are already incorporating some of the lessons learned into the next iteration.&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span face="&quot;Google Sans&quot;, sans-serif" style="font-size: 12pt; vertical-align: baseline;">We are committed to advancing the AI cybersecurity frontier and will continue working with the community to build tools that help protect people online. Stay tuned as we plan to share more research and key learnings from the CTF with the broader community.</span></p><br /></span><br /></div>

<p>Apple has introduced a new hardware/software security feature in the iPhone 17: &#8220;<a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/">Memory Integrity Enforcement</a>,&#8221; targeting the memory safety vulnerabilities that spyware products like Pegasus tend to use to get unauthorized system access. From <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-17-memory-integrity-enforcement/"><i>Wired</i></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In recent years, a movement has been steadily growing across the global tech industry to address a ubiquitous and insidious type of bugs known as memory-safety vulnerabilities. A computer&#8217;s memory is a shared resource among all programs, and memory safety issues crop up when software can pull data that should be off limits from a computer&#8217;s memory or manipulate data in memory that shouldn&#8217;t be accessible to the program. When developers&#8212;­even experienced and security-conscious developers&#8212;­write software in ubiquitous, historic programming languages, like C and C++, it&#8217;s easy to make mistakes that lead to memory safety vulnerabilities. That&#8217;s why proactive tools like ...</p></blockquote>
