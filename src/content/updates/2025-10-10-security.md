### [Flok License Plate Surveillance](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/flok-license-plate-surveillance.html) - October 08, 2025

<p>The company Flok is <a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1982690/police-flock-cameras-sued-for-tracking-man-526-times/">surveilling us</a> as we drive:</p>
<blockquote><p>A retired veteran named Lee Schmidt wanted to know how often Norfolk, Virginia&#8217;s 176 Flock Safety automated license-plate-reader cameras were tracking him. The answer, according to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26101033-norfolk_flock/">U.S. District Court</a> lawsuit filed in September, was more than four times a day, or 526 times from mid-February to early July. No, there&#8217;s no warrant out for Schmidt&#8217;s arrest, nor is there a warrant for Schmidt&#8217;s co-plaintiff, Crystal Arrington, whom the system tagged 849 times in roughly the same period.</p>
<p>You might think this sounds like it violates the Fourth Amendment, which protects American citizens from unreasonable searches and seizures without probable cause. Well, so does the American Civil Liberties Union. Norfolk, Virginia Judge Jamilah LeCruise also agrees, and in 2024 she ruled that plate-reader data obtained without a search warrant couldn&#8217;t be used against a defendant in a robbery case...</p></blockquote>

### [AI-Enabled Influence Operation Against Iran](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/ai-enabled-influence-operation-against-iran.html) - October 07, 2025

<p>Citizen Lab has <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2025/10/ai-enabled-io-aimed-at-overthrowing-iranian-regime/">uncovered</a> a coordinated AI-enabled influence operation against the Iranian government, probably conducted by Israel.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A coordinated network of more than 50 inauthentic X profiles is conducting an AI-enabled influence operation. The network, which we refer to as &#8220;PRISONBREAK,&#8221; is spreading narratives inciting Iranian audiences to revolt against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
<li>While the network was created in 2023, almost all of its activity was conducted starting in January 2025, and continues to the present day.
<li>The profiles&#8217; activity appears to have been synchronized, at least in part, with the military campaign that the Israel Defense Forces conducted against Iranian targets in June 2025.
