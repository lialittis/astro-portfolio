As Cybersecurity Awareness Month wraps up, we’re focusing on one of today's most pervasive digital threats: mobile scams. In the last 12 months, fraudsters have used advanced AI tools to create more convincing schemes, resulting in over $400 billion in stolen funds globally.<strong><a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn1" id="fnref1">¹</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
For years, Android has been on the frontlines in the battle against scammers, using the best of Google AI to build proactive, multi-layered protections that can anticipate and block scams before they reach you. Android’s scam defenses protect users around the world from over 10 billion suspected malicious calls and messages every month<strong><sup><a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></strong>. In addition, Google continuously performs safety checks to maintain the integrity of the RCS service. In the past month alone, this ongoing process blocked over 100 million suspicious numbers from using RCS, stopping potential scams before they could even be sent. 
</p>
<p>
To show how our scam protections work in the real world, we asked users and independent security experts to compare how well Android and iOS protect you from these threats. We're also releasing a new <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/android_2025_text_based_scams_report.pdf">report</a> that explains how modern text scams are orchestrated, helping you understand the tactics fraudsters use and how to spot them.

<strong>Survey shows Android users’ confidence in scam protections</strong>
</p>
<p>
Google and YouGov<strong><sup><a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></strong> surveyed 5,000 smartphone users across the U.S., India, and Brazil about their experiences. The findings were clear: Android users reported receiving fewer scam texts and felt more confident that their device was keeping them safe.
</p>
<ul>

<li>Android users were 58% more likely than iOS users to say they had not received any scam texts in the week prior to the survey. The advantage was even stronger on Pixel, where users were 96% more likely than iPhone owners to report zero scam texts.</li>

<li>At the other end of the spectrum, iOS users were 65% more likely than Android users to report receiving three or more scam texts in a week. The difference became even more pronounced when comparing iPhone to Pixel, with iPhone users 136% more likely to say they had received a heavy volume of scam messages.</li>

<li>Android users were 20% more likely than iOS users to describe their device’s scam protections as “very effective” or “extremely effective.” When comparing Pixel to iPhone, iPhone users were 150% more likely to say their device was not effective at all in stopping mobile fraud.</li>

<em>Leviathan Security Group comparison of scam protections across various devices</em>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Why Android users see fewer scams</strong>
</p>
<p>
Android’s proactive protections work across the platform to help you stay ahead of threats with the best of Google AI. 
</p>
<p>
Here’s how they work:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Keeping your messages safe: </strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging">Google Messages</a> automatically filters known spam by analyzing sender reputation and message content, moving suspicious texts directly to your "spam & blocked" folder to keep them out of sight. For more complex threats, Scam Detection uses on-device AI to analyze messages from unknown senders for patterns of conversational scams (like pig butchering) and provide real-time warnings<strong><sup><a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn6" id="fnref6a">6</a></sup></strong>.  This helps secure your privacy while providing a robust shield against text scams. As an extra safeguard, Google Messages also helps block suspicious links in messages that are determined to be spam or scams.</li>

<li><strong>Combatting phone call scams:</strong> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.dialer">Phone by Google</a> automatically blocks known spam calls so your phone never even rings, while Call Screen<strong><sup><a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn5" id="fnref5b">5</a></sup></strong> can answer the call on your behalf to identify fraudsters. If you answer, the protection continues with Scam Detection, which uses on-device AI to provide real-time warnings for suspicious conversational patterns<strong><sup><a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn6" id="fnref6b">6</a></sup></strong>. This processing is completely ephemeral, meaning no call content is ever saved or leaves your device. Android also helps stop social engineering during the call itself by blocking high-risk actions<strong><sup><a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn6" id="fnref6c">6</a> </sup></strong>like installing untrusted apps or disabling security settings, and warns you if your screen is being shared unknowingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These safeguards are built directly into the core of Android, alongside other features like real-time app scanning in <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853?hl=en">Google Play Protect</a> and enhanced <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/9890866?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">Safe Browsing</a> in Chrome using LLMs. With Android, you can trust that you have intelligent, multi-layered protection against scams working for you.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Android is always evolving to keep you one step ahead of scams</strong> 
</p>
<p>
In a world of evolving digital threats, you deserve to feel confident that your phone is keeping you safe. That’s why we use the best of Google AI to build intelligent protections that are always improving and work for you around the clock, so you can connect, browse, and communicate with peace of mind.

### [Vulnerabilities in LUKS2 disk encryption for confidential VMs](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/10/30/vulnerabilities-in-luks2-disk-encryption-for-confidential-vms/) - October 30, 2025

<p>Trail of Bits is disclosing vulnerabilities in eight different confidential computing systems that use Linux Unified Key Setup version 2 (LUKS2) for disk encryption. Using these vulnerabilities, a malicious actor with access to storage disks can extract all confidential data stored on that disk and can modify the contents of the disk arbitrarily. The vulnerabilities are caused by malleable metadata headers that allow an attacker to trick a trusted execution environment guest into encrypting secret data with a null cipher.
The following CVEs are associated with this disclosure:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-59054">CVE-2025-59054</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58356">CVE-2025-58356</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a coordinated disclosure; we have notified the following projects, which remediated the issues prior to our publication.</p>
<ul>
<li>Oasis Protocol: <a href="https://github.com/oasisprotocol/oasis-sdk/releases/tag/rofl-containers%2Fv0.7.2dk/"><code>oasis-sdk</code></a> (v0.7.2)</li>

<li>Cosmian VM: <a href="https://github.com/Cosmian/cosmian_vm"><code>cosmian-vm</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>We <a href="https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/-/issues/954">notified the maintainers of <code>cryptsetup</code></a>, resulting in a partial mitigation introduced in <code>cryptsetup</code> v2.8.1.</p>
<p>We also notified the Confidential Containers project, who indicated that the relevant code, part of the <a href="https://github.com/confidential-containers/guest-components"><code>guest-components</code></a> repository, is not currently used in production.</p>
<p>Users of these confidential computing frameworks should update to the latest version. Consumers of remote attestation reports should disallow pre-patch versions in attestation reports.</p>
<p>Exploitation of this issue requires write access to encrypted disks. We do not have any indication that this issue has been exploited in the wild.</p>
<p>These systems all use trusted execution environments such as AMD SEV-SNP and Intel TDX to protect a confidential Linux VM from a potentially malicious host. Each relies on LUKS2 to protect disk volumes used to hold the VM’s persistent state. LUKS2 is a disk encryption format originally designed for at-rest encryption of PC and server hard disks. We found that LUKS is not always secure in settings where the disk is subject to modifications by an attacker.</p>
<h2 id="confidential-vms">Confidential VMs</h2>
<p>The affected systems are Linux-based confidential virtual machines (CVMs). These are not interactive Linux boxes with user logins; they are specialized automated systems designed to handle secrets while running in an untrusted environment. Typical use cases are private AI inference, private blockchains, or multi-party data collaboration. Such a system should satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confidentiality: The host OS should not be able to read memory or data inside the CVM.</li>
<li>Integrity: The host OS should not be able to interfere with the logical operation of the CVM.</li>
<li>Authenticity: A remote party should be able to verify that they are interacting with a genuine CVM running the expected program.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remote users verify the authenticity of a CVM via a remote attestation process, in which the secure hardware generates a “quote” signed by a secret key provisioned by the hardware manufacturer. This quote contains measurements of the CVM configuration and code. If an attacker with access to the host machine can read secret data from the CVM or tamper with the code it runs, the security guarantees of the system are broken.</p>
<p>The confidential computing setting turns typical trust assumptions on their heads. Decades of work has gone into protecting host boxes from malicious VMs, but very few Linux utilities are designed to protect a VM from a malicious host. The issue described in this post is just one trap in a broader minefield of unsafe patterns that CVM-based systems must navigate. If your team is building a confidential computing solution and is concerned about unknown footguns, we are happy to offer a free <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1VVGPLTjiRduOpGNOh2sHUgdffjk">office hours call</a> with one of our engineers.</p>
<h2 id="the-luks2-on-disk-format">The LUKS2 on-disk format</h2>
<p>A disk using the LUKS2 encryption format starts with a header, followed by the actual encrypted data. The header contains two identical copies of binary and JSON-formatted metadata sections, followed by some number of keyslots.



 <figure>
 <img alt="&ldquo;Figure 1: LUKS2 on-disk encryption format&rdquo;" src="https://blog.trailofbits.com/img/luks2-vuln-disclosure/luks2-disclosure-1.png" />
 <figcaption>Figure 1: LUKS2 on-disk encryption format</figcaption>
 </figure>

</p>
<p>Each keyslot contains a copy of the volume key, encrypted with a single user password or token. The JSON metadata section defines which keyslots are enabled, what cipher is used to unlock each keyslot, and what cipher is used for the encrypted data segments.</p>
<p>Here is a typical JSON metadata object for a disk with a single keyslot. The keyslot uses Argon2id and AES-XTS to encrypt the volume key under a user password. The segment object defines the cipher used to encrypt the data volume. The digest object stores a hash of the volume key, which <code>cryptsetup</code> uses to check whether the correct passphrase was provided.</p>

<p>The <code>cipher_null-ecb</code> algorithm does nothing. It ignores its key and returns data unchanged. In particular, it simply ignores its key and acts as the identity function on the data. Any attacker can change the cipher, fiddle with some digests, and hand the resulting disk to an unsuspecting CVM; the CVM will then use the disk as if it were securely encrypted, reading configuration data from and writing secrets to the completely unencrypted volume.</p>
<p>When a null cipher is used to encrypt a keyslot, that keyslot can be successfully opened with <em>any</em> passphrase. In this case, the attacker does not need any information about the CVM’s encryption keys to produce a malicious disk.</p>
<p>We disclosed this issue to the <code>cryptsetup</code> maintainers, who warned that LUKS is not intended to provide integrity in this setting and asserted that the presence of null ciphers is important for backward compatibility. In <code>cryptsetup</code> 2.8.1 and higher, null ciphers are now rejected as keyslot ciphers when used with a nonempty password.</p>
<p>Null ciphers remain in <code>cryptsetup</code> 2.8.1 as a valid option for volume keys. In order to exploit this weakness, an attacker simply needs to observe the header from some encrypted disk formatted using the target CVM’s passphrase. When the volume encryption is set to <code>cipher_null-ecb</code> and the keyslot cipher is left untouched, a CVM will be able to unlock the keyslot using its passphrase and start using the unencrypted volume without error.</p>
<h2 id="validating-luks-metadata">Validating LUKS metadata</h2>
<p>For any confidential computing application, it is imperative to fully validate the LUKS header before use. Luckily, <code>cryptsetup</code> provides a detached-header mode, which allows the disk header to be read from a tmpfs file rather than the untrusted disk, as in this example:</p>
<figure class="highlight">
 <pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">cryptsetup open --header /tmp/luks_header /dev/vdb</span></span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>Use of detached-header mode is critical in all remediation options, in order to prevent time-of-check to time-of-use attacks.</p>
<p>Beyond the issue with null ciphers, LUKS metadata processing is a complex and potentially dangerous process. For example, <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-4122">CVE-2021-4122</a> used a similar issue to silently decrypt the whole disk as part of an automatic recovery process.</p>
<p>There are three potential ways to validate the header, once it resides in protected memory.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use a MAC to ensure that the header has not been modified after initial creation.</li>
<li>Validate the header parameters to ensure only secure values are used.</li>
<li>Include the header as a measurement in TPM or remote KMS attestations.</li>
</ol>
<p>We recommend the first option where possible; by computing a MAC over the full header, applications can be sure that the header is entirely unmodified by malicious actors. See Flashbots’ implementation of this fix in <a href="https://github.com/flashbots/tdx-init/pull/1/files"><code>tdx-init</code></a> as an example of the technique.</p>
<p>If backward compatibility is required, applications may parse the JSON metadata section and validate all relevant fields, as in this example:</p>

<p>Finally, one may measure the header data, with any random salts and digests removed, into the attestation state. This measurement is incorporated into any TPM sealing PCRs or attestations sent to a KMS. In this model, LUKS header configuration becomes part of the CVM identity and allows remote verifiers to set arbitrary policies with respect to what configurations are allowed to receive decryption keys.</p>

One year from now, with the release of Chrome 154 in October 2026, we will change the default settings of Chrome to enable “Always Use Secure Connections”. This means Chrome will ask for the user's permission before the first access to any public site without HTTPS.

<p style="text-align: center;">
The “Always Use Secure Connections” setting warns users before accessing a site without HTTPS
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://chrome.security">Chrome Security's mission</a> is to make it safe to click on links. Part of being safe means ensuring that when a user types a URL or clicks on a link, the browser ends up where the user intended. When links don't use HTTPS, an attacker can hijack the navigation and force Chrome users to load arbitrary, attacker-controlled resources, and expose the user to malware, targeted exploitation, or social engineering attacks. Attacks like this are not hypothetical—software to hijack navigations is readily available and attackers have previously used insecure HTTP to <a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/0-days-exploited-by-commercial-surveillance-vendor-in-egypt/#:~:text=exploit%20delivery%20via%20man-in-the-middle%20(mitm)">compromise user devices</a> in a targeted attack.
</p>
<p>
Since attackers only need a single insecure navigation, they don't need to worry that many sites have adopted HTTPS—any single HTTP navigation may offer a foothold. What's worse, many plaintext HTTP connections today are entirely invisible to users, as HTTP sites may immediately redirect to HTTPS sites. That gives users no opportunity to see Chrome's "Not Secure" URL bar warnings after the risk has occurred, and no opportunity to keep themselves safe in the first place.
</p>
<p>
To address this risk, we <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/07/increasing-https-adoption.html">launched the “Always Use Secure Connections” setting</a> in 2022 as an opt-in option. In this mode, Chrome attempts every connection over HTTPS, and shows a bypassable warning to the user if HTTPS is unavailable. We also previously discussed our intent to move <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/towards-https-by-default.html">towards HTTPS by default</a>. We now think the time has come to enable “Always Use Secure Connections” for all users by default.
</p>
<h2>Now is the time.</h2>


<p>
For more than a decade, Google has published the <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/https/overview?hl=en">HTTPS transparency report</a>, which tracks the percentage of navigations in Chrome that use HTTPS. For the first several years of the report, numbers saw an impressive climb, starting at around 30-45% in 2015, and ending up around the 95-99% range around 2020. Since then, progress has largely plateaued. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
HTTPS adoption expressed as a percentage of main frame page loads
</p>
<p>
This rise represents a tremendous improvement to the security of the web, and demonstrates that HTTPS is now mature and widespread. This level of adoption is what makes it possible to consider stronger mitigations against the remaining insecure HTTP.
</p>
<h2>Balancing user safety with friction</h2>


<p>
While it may at first seem that 95% HTTPS means that the problem is mostly solved, the truth is that a few percentage points of HTTP navigations is still <em>a lot</em> of navigations. Since HTTP navigations remain a regular occurrence for most Chrome users, a naive approach to warning on all HTTP navigations would be quite disruptive. At the same time, as the plateau demonstrates, doing nothing would allow this risk to persist indefinitely. To balance these risks, we have taken steps to ensure that we can help the web move towards safer defaults, while limiting the potential annoyance warnings will cause to users. 
</p>
<p>
One way we're balancing risks to users is by making sure Chrome does not warn about the same sites excessively. In all variants of the "Always Use Secure Connections" settings, so long as the user regularly visits an insecure site, Chrome will not warn the user about that site repeatedly. This means that rather than warn users about 1 out of 50 navigations, Chrome will only warn users when they visit a new (or not recently visited) site without using HTTPS.
</p>
<p>
To further address the issue, it's important to understand what sort of traffic is still using HTTP. The largest contributor to insecure HTTP by far, and the largest contributor to variation across platforms, is insecure navigations to <em>private</em> sites. The graph above includes both those to public sites, such as <code>example.com</code>, and navigations to private sites, such as local IP addresses like <code>192.168.0.1</code>,  single-label hostnames, and shortlinks like <code>intranet/</code>. While it is free and easy to get an HTTPS certificate that is trusted by Chrome for a public site, acquiring an HTTPS certificate for a private site unfortunately remains complicated. This is because private names are "non-unique"—private names can refer to different hosts on different networks. There is no single owner of <code>192.168.0.1</code> for a certification authority to validate and issue a certificate to.
</p>
<p>
HTTP navigations to private sites can still be risky, but are typically less dangerous than their public site counterparts because there are fewer ways for an attacker to take advantage of these HTTP navigations. HTTP on private sites can only be abused by an attacker also on your local network, like on your home wifi or in a corporate network.
</p>
<p>
If you exclude navigations to private sites, then the distribution becomes much tighter across platforms. In particular, Linux jumps from 84% HTTPS to nearly 97% HTTPS when limiting the analysis to public sites only. Windows increases from 95% to 98% HTTPS, and both Android and Mac increase to over 99% HTTPS.
</p>
<p>
In recognition of the reduced risk HTTP to private sites represents, last year we introduced a variant of “Always Use Secure Connections” for <em>public sites only</em>. For users who frequently access private sites (such as those in enterprise settings, or web developers), excluding warnings on private sites significantly reduces the volume of warnings those users will see. Simultaneously, for users who do not access private sites frequently, this mode introduces only a small reduction in protection. This is the variant we intend to enable for all users next year.

<em>“Always Use Secure Connections,” available at chrome://settings/security</em>
</p>
<p>
In Chrome 141, we experimented with enabling “Always Use Secure Connections” for public sites by default for a small percentage of users. We wanted to validate our expectations that this setting keeps users safer without burdening them with excessive warnings. 
</p>
<p>
Analyzing the data from the experiment, we confirmed that the number of warnings seen by any users is considerably lower than 3% of navigations—in fact, the median user sees fewer than one warning per week, and the ninety-fifth percentile user sees fewer than three warnings per week..
</p>
<h2>Understanding HTTP usage</h2>


<p>
Once “Always Use Secure Connections” is the default and additional sites migrate away from HTTP, we expect the actual warning volume to be even lower than it is now. In parallel to our experiments, we have reached out to a number of companies responsible for the most HTTP navigations, and expect that they will be able to migrate away from HTTP before the change in Chrome 154. For many of these organizations, transitioning to HTTPS isn't disproportionately hard, but simply has not received attention. For example, many of these sites use HTTP only for navigations that immediately redirect to HTTPS sites—an insecure interaction which was previously completely invisible to users.
</p>
<p>
Another current use case for HTTP is to avoid mixed content blocking when accessing devices on the local network. Private addresses, as discussed above, often do not have trusted HTTPS certificates, due to the difficulties of validating ownership of a non-unique name. This means most local network traffic is over HTTP, and cannot be initiated from an HTTPS page—the HTTP traffic counts as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content">insecure mixed content</a>, and is blocked. One common use case for needing to access the local network is to configure a local network device, e.g. the manufacturer might host a configuration portal at <code>config.example.com</code>, which then sends requests to a local device to configure it.
</p>
<p>
Previously, these types of pages needed to be hosted without HTTPS to avoid mixed content blocking. However, we recently introduced a <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/local-network-access">local network access permission</a>, which both prevents sites from accessing the user’s local network without consent, but also allows an HTTPS site to bypass mixed content checks for the local network once the permission has been granted. This can unblock migrating these domains to HTTPS.
</p>
<h2>Changes in Chrome </h2>


<p>
We will enable the "Always Use Secure Connections" setting in its public-sites variant <em>by default</em> in October 2026, with the release of Chrome 154. Prior to enabling it by default for all users, in Chrome 147, releasing in April 2026, we will enable Always Use Secure Connections in its public-sites variant for the <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-safe-browsing-one-billion-users/">over 1 billion users</a> who have opted-in to Enhanced Safe Browsing protections in Chrome.
</p>
<p>
While it is our hope and expectation that this transition will be relatively painless for most users, users will still be able to disable the warnings by disabling the "Always Use Secure Connections" setting.
</p>
<p>
If you are a website developer or IT professional, and you have users who may be impacted by this feature, we very strongly recommend enabling the "Always Use Secure Connections" setting today to help identify sites that you may need to work to migrate. IT professionals may find it useful to read our <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/ask-before-http/ask-before-http-adoption-guide.md">additional resources</a> to better understand the circumstances where warnings will be shown, how to mitigate them, and how organizations that manage Chrome clients (like enterprises or educational institutions) can ensure that Chrome shows the right warnings to meet those organizations' needs.
</p>
<h2>Looking Forward</h2>


<p>
While we believe that warning on insecure public sites represents a significant step forward for the security of the web, there is still more work to be done. In the future, we hope to work to further reduce barriers to adoption of HTTPS, especially for local network sites. This work will hopefully enable even more robust HTTP protections down the road.
