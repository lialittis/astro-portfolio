### [On Hacking Back](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/on-hacking-back.html) - November 12, 2025

<p>Former DoJ attorney John Carlin <a href="https://www.aspendigital.org/blog/so-you-want-to-hack-back/">writes</a> about hackback, which he defines thus: &#8220;A hack back is a type of cyber response that incorporates a counterattack designed to proactively engage with, disable, or collect evidence about an attacker. Although hack backs can take on various forms, they are&#8212;­by definition­&#8212;not passive defensive measures.&#8221;</p>
<p>His conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the law currently stands, specific forms of purely defense measures are authorized so long as they affect only the victim’s system or data.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, offensive measures that involve accessing or otherwise causing damage or loss to the hacker’s systems are likely prohibited, absent government oversight or authorization. And even then parties should proceed with caution in light of the heightened risks of misattribution, collateral damage, and retaliation...</p></blockquote>

Active Directory remains the authentication backbone for&nbsp;over 90% of Fortune 1000 companies. AD's importance has grown as companies adopt hybrid and cloud infrastructure, but so has its complexity. Every application, user, and device traces back to AD for authentication and authorization, making it the ultimate target. For attackers, it represents the holy grail: compromise Active

### [New Attacks Against Secure Enclaves](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/new-attacks-against-secure-enclaves.html) - November 10, 2025

<p>Encryption can protect data at rest and data in transit, but does nothing for data in use. What we have are secure enclaves. I&#8217;ve <a href="https://www.schneier.com/academic/archives/2023/12/decoupling-for-security.html">written about</a> this before:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful...</p></blockquote>
