### [Level up your Solidity LLM tooling with Slither-MCP](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/11/15/level-up-your-solidity-llm-tooling-with-slither-mcp/) - November 15, 2025

<p>We’re releasing <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/slither-mcp">Slither-MCP</a>, a new tool that augments LLMs with Slither’s unmatched static analysis engine. Slither-MCP benefits virtually every use case for LLMs by exposing Slither’s static analysis API via tools, allowing LLMs to find critical code faster, navigate codebases more efficiently, and ultimately improve smart contract authoring and auditing performance.</p>
<h2 id="how-slither-mcp-works">How Slither-MCP works</h2>
<p>Slither-MCP is an MCP server that wraps Slither’s static analysis functionality, making it accessible through the Model Context Protocol. It can analyze Solidity projects (Foundry, Hardhat, etc.) and generate comprehensive metadata about contracts, functions, inheritance hierarchies, and more.</p>
<p>When an LLM uses Slither-MCP, it no longer has to rely on rudimentary tools like grep and <code>read_file</code> to identify where certain functions are implemented, who a function’s callers are, and other complex, error-prone tasks.</p>
<p>Because LLMs are probabilistic systems, in most cases they are only probabilistically correct. Slither-MCP helps set a ground truth for LLM-based analysis using traditional static analysis: it reduces token use and increases the probability a prompt is answered correctly.</p>
<h3 id="example-simplifying-an-auditing-task">Example: Simplifying an auditing task</h3>
<p>Consider a project that contains two ERC20 contracts: one used in the production deployment, and one used in tests. An LLM is tasked with auditing a contract’s use of <code>ERC20.transfer()</code>, and needs to locate the source code of the function.</p>
<p>Without Slither-MCP, the LLM has two options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Try to resolve the import path of the ERC20 contract, then try to call <code>read_file</code> to view the source of <code>ERC20.transfer()</code>. This option usually requires multiple calls to <code>read_file</code>, especially if the call to <code>ERC20.transfer()</code> is through a child contract that is inherited from ERC20. Regardless, this option will be error-prone and tool call intensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to use the grep tool to locate the implementation of <code>ERC20.transfer()</code>. Depending on how the grep tool call is structured, it may return the wrong ERC20 contract.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Both options are non-ideal, error-prone, and not likely to be correct with a high interval of confidence.</p>
<p>Using Slither-MCP, the LLM simply calls <code>get_function_source</code> to locate the source code of the function.</p>
<h2 id="simple-setup">Simple setup</h2>
<p>Slither-MCP is easy to set up, and can be added to Claude Code using the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight">
 <pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">claude mcp add --transport stdio slither -- uvx --from git+https://github.com/trailofbits/slither-mcp slither-mcp</span></span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>It is also easy to add Slither-MCP to Cursor by adding the following to your <code>~/.cursor/mcp.json</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight">
 <pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">{</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span></span></span></code></pre>
 <figcaption><span>Figure 1: Adding Slither-MCP to Cursor</span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For now, Slither-MCP exposes a subset of Slither’s analysis engine that we believe LLMs would have the most benefit consuming. This includes the following functionalities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extracting the source code of a given contract or function for analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying the callers and callees of a function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identifying the contract’s derived and inherited members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Locating potential implementations of a function based on signature (e.g., finding concrete definitions for <code>IOracle.price(...)</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Running Slither’s exhaustive suite of detectors and filtering the results</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have requests or suggestions for new MCP tools, <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/slither-mcp/issues">we’d love to hear from you</a>.</p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>Slither-MCP is licensed AGPLv3, the same license Slither uses. This license requires publishing the full source code of your application if you use it in a web service or SaaS product. For many tools, this isn’t an acceptable compromise.</p>
<p>To help remediate this, we are now offering dual licensing for both Slither and Slither-MCP. By offering dual licensing, Slither and Slither-MCP can be used to power LLM-based security web apps without publishing your entire source code, and without having to spend years reproducing its feature set.</p>
<p>If you are currently using Slither in your commercial web application, or are interested in using it, please <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/contact/">reach out</a>.</p>

### [Friday Squid Blogging: Pilot Whales Eat a Lot of Squid](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/friday-squid-blogging-pilot-whales-eat-a-lot-of-squid.html) - November 14, 2025

<p>Short-finned pilot wales (<i>Globicephala macrorhynchus</i>) eat <a href="https://gizmodo.com/scientists-wanted-to-know-how-many-squid-pilot-whales-eat-each-day-what-they-found-was-astounding-2000685522">at lot</a> of squid:</p>
<blockquote><p>To figure out a short-finned pilot whale&#8217;s caloric intake, Gough says, the team had to combine data from a variety of sources, including movement data from short-lasting tags, daily feeding rates from satellite tags, body measurements collected via aerial drones, and sifting through the stomachs of unfortunate whales that ended up stranded on land.</p>
<p>Once the team pulled all this data together, they estimated that a typical whale will eat between 82 and 202 squid a day. To meet their energy needs, a whale will have to consume an average of 140 squid a day. Annually, that&#8217;s about 74,000 squid per whale. For all the whales in the area, that amounts to about 88,000 tons of squid eaten every year...</p></blockquote>

<p>As AI capabilities grow, we must delineate the roles that should remain exclusively human. The line seems to be between fact-based decisions and judgment-based decisions.</p>
<p>For example, in a medical context, if an AI was demonstrably better at reading a test result and diagnosing cancer than a human, you would take the AI in a second. You want the more accurate tool. But justice is harder because justice is inherently a human quality in a way that &#8220;Is this tumor cancerous?&#8221; is not. That&#8217;s a fact-based question. &#8220;What&#8217;s the right thing to do here?&#8221; is a human-based question...</p>

### [How we avoided side-channels in our new post-quantum Go cryptography libraries](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/11/14/how-we-avoided-side-channels-in-our-new-post-quantum-go-cryptography-libraries/) - November 14, 2025

<p>The Trail of Bits cryptography team is releasing our open-source pure Go implementations of <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/ml-dsa">ML-DSA (FIPS-204)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/go-slh-dsa">SLH-DSA (FIPS-205)</a>, two NIST-standardized post-quantum signature algorithms. These implementations have been engineered and reviewed by several of our cryptographers, so if you or your organization is looking to transition to post-quantum support for digital signatures, try them out!</p>
<p>This post will detail some of the work we did to ensure the implementations are constant time. These tricks specifically apply to the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final">ML-DSA (FIPS-204)</a> algorithm, protecting from attacks like <a href="https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/">KyberSlash</a>, but they also apply to any cryptographic algorithm that requires branching or division.</p>
<h2 id="the-road-to-constant-time-fips-204">The road to constant-time FIPS-204</h2>
<p><a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/205/final">SLH-DSA (FIPS-205)</a> is relatively easy to implement without introducing side channels, as it&rsquo;s based on pseudorandom functions built from hash functions, but the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/204/final">ML-DSA (FIPS-204)</a> specification includes several integer divisions, which require more careful consideration.</p>
<p>Division was the root cause of a timing attack called <a href="https://kyberslash.cr.yp.to/">KyberSlash</a> that impacted early implementations of Kyber, which later became ML-KEM (FIPS-203). We wanted to avoid this risk entirely in our implementation.</p>
<p>Each of the ML-DSA parameter sets (ML-DSA-44, ML-DSA-65, and ML-DSA-87) include several other parameters that affect the behavior of the algorithm. One of those is called $γ_2$, the low-order rounding range.</p>
<p>$γ_2$ is always an integer, but its value depends on the parameter set. For ML-DSA-44, $γ_2$ is equal to 95232. For ML-DSA-65 and ML-DSA-87, $γ_2$ is equal to 261888.</p>
<p>ML-DSA specifies an algorithm called <code>Decompose</code>, which converts a field element into two components ($r_1$, $r_0$) such that $(r_1 \cdot 2γ_2) + r_0$ equals the original field element. This requires dividing by $2γ_2$ in one step and calculating the remainder of $2γ_2$ in another.</p>
<p>If you ask an AI to implement the <code>Decompose</code> algorithm for you, you will get something like this:</p>

<p>However, this violates cryptography engineering best practices:</p>

<h3 id="zen-and-the-art-of-branchless-cryptography">Zen and the art of branchless cryptography</h3>
<p>The straightforward approach to preventing branches in any cryptography algorithm is to always perform both sides of the condition (true and false) and then use a constant-time conditional swap based on the condition to obtain the correct result.

<h3 id="one-neat-optimization-trick-barrett-reduction">One neat optimization trick: Barrett reduction</h3>
<p>Since the value $γ_2$ is fixed for a given parameter set, and the division and modulo operators are performed against $2γ_2$, we can use Barrett reduction with precomputed values instead of division.</p>
<p><strong>Barrett reduction</strong> involves multiplying by a reciprocal (in our case, $2^{64}/2γ_2$) and then performing up to two corrective subtractions to obtain a remainder. The quotient is produced as a byproduct of this calculation.</p>

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Jeff Vander Stoep, Android</span>

<p>
<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html">Last year, we wrote</a> about why a memory safety strategy that focuses on vulnerability prevention in new code quickly yields durable and compounding gains. This year we look at how <strong>this approach isn’t just fixing things, but helping us move faster</strong>.
</p>
<p>
The 2025 data continues to validate the approach, with memory safety vulnerabilities falling below 20% of total vulnerabilities for the first time.

    <em>Updated data for 2025. This data covers first-party and third-party (open source) code changes to the Android platform across C, C++, Java, Kotlin, and Rust. This post is published a couple of months before the end of 2025, but Android’s industry-standard 90-day patch window means that these results are very likely close to final. We can and will accelerate patching when necessary.</em>
</p>
<p>
We adopted Rust for its security and are seeing <strong>a 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android’s C and C++ code</strong>. But the biggest surprise was Rust's impact on software delivery. With Rust changes having <strong>a 4x lower rollback rate</strong> and spending <strong>25% less time in code review</strong>, the safer path is now also the faster one. 
</p>
<p>
In this post, we dig into the data behind this shift and also cover:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>How we’re expanding our reach:</strong> We're pushing to make secure code the default across our entire software stack. We have updates on Rust adoption in first-party apps, the Linux kernel, and firmware.</li>

<li><strong>Our first rust memory safety vulnerability...almost:</strong> We'll analyze a near-miss memory safety bug in unsafe Rust: how it happened, how it was mitigated, and steps we're taking to prevent recurrence. It’s also a good chance to answer the question “if Rust can have memory safety issues, why bother at all?”</li>

<h1>Building Better Software, Faster</h1>


<p>
Developing an operating system requires the low-level control and predictability of systems programming languages like C, C++, and Rust. While Java and Kotlin are important for Android platform development, their role is complementary to the systems languages rather than interchangeable. <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/04/rust-in-android-platform.html">We introduced Rust into Android</a> as a direct alternative to C and C++, offering a similar level of control but without many of their risks. We focus this analysis on new and actively developed code because our data shows this to be <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/eliminating-memory-safety-vulnerabilities-Android.html">an effective approach</a>.
</p>
<p>
When we look at development in systems languages (excluding Java and Kotlin), two trends emerge: a steep rise in Rust usage and a slower but steady decline in new C++.
</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-MWhK4zEb7DBnAO8eF3DRxQ-T7p_LCkl7qApGBxda2fiHroOHwMQYlIfYHsZLakB6XiyOynkJbTVShIXe5pzqw7VXcZSAzflS7PyzUrM_8ZUVXOgudYo9bmgvhA7CVACfh5OS0wfOHbBczW_poHUfI8lngMWiuLs9Z5I0arQ-Z_e7WBzgSzOCUSHymx7Z/s1600/image1%20%281%29.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj-MWhK4zEb7DBnAO8eF3DRxQ-T7p_LCkl7qApGBxda2fiHroOHwMQYlIfYHsZLakB6XiyOynkJbTVShIXe5pzqw7VXcZSAzflS7PyzUrM_8ZUVXOgudYo9bmgvhA7CVACfh5OS0wfOHbBczW_poHUfI8lngMWiuLs9Z5I0arQ-Z_e7WBzgSzOCUSHymx7Z/s1600/image1%20%281%29.png" /></a></div>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<em>Net lines of code added: Rust vs. C++, first-party Android code.<br />This chart focuses on first-party (Google-developed) code (unlike the previous chart that included all first-party and third-party code in Android.) We only include systems languages, C/C++ (which is primarily C++), and Rust.</em>
</p>
<p>
The chart shows that the volume of new Rust code now rivals that of C++, enabling reliable comparisons of software development process metrics. To measure this, we use the DORA<sup id="fnref1"><a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> framework, a decade-long research program that has become the industry standard for evaluating software engineering team performance. <a href="https://dora.dev/guides/dora-metrics-four-keys/">DORA metrics</a> focus on:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Throughput: the velocity of delivering software changes.</li>

<li>Stability: the quality of those changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Cross-language comparisons can be challenging. We use several techniques to ensure the comparisons are reliable.
</p>
<ul>

<li>Similar sized changes: Rust and C++ have similar functionality density, though Rust is slightly denser. This difference favors C++, but the comparison is still valid. We use <a href="https://issues.gerritcodereview.com/issues/40007892">Gerrit’s change size definitions</a>.</li>

<li>Similar developer pools: We only consider first-party changes from Android platform developers. Most are software engineers at Google, and there is considerable overlap between pools with many contributing in both.</li>

<li>Track trends over time: As Rust adoption increases, are metrics changing steadily, accelerating the pace, or reverting to the mean? </li>
</ul>
<h2>Throughput</h2>


<p>
Code review is a time-consuming and high-latency part of the development process. Reworking code is a primary source of these costly delays. Data shows that Rust code requires fewer revisions. This trend has been consistent since 2023. Rust changes of a similar size need about 20% fewer revisions than their C++ counterparts.
</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisLm7jCyRVHZIyKf4awb-HpBwUdYAFui-tdFR9IqyyMN-OcdC91wsriqWRMsyTKtceUN3sGwe1DfcvFJliEH98ps2yq42sAAPGQFKtJ446pYENZK55x6AECT480e0lSTRZLkgLdRYvd-CT1cw1uXidOjw_aOJPDalbapWiL-lK8MjRGhqtduhTFINxT4AZ/s1600/image3.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisLm7jCyRVHZIyKf4awb-HpBwUdYAFui-tdFR9IqyyMN-OcdC91wsriqWRMsyTKtceUN3sGwe1DfcvFJliEH98ps2yq42sAAPGQFKtJ446pYENZK55x6AECT480e0lSTRZLkgLdRYvd-CT1cw1uXidOjw_aOJPDalbapWiL-lK8MjRGhqtduhTFINxT4AZ/s1600/image3.png" /></a></div>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
In addition, Rust changes currently spend about 25% less time in code review compared to C++. We speculate that the significant change in favor of Rust between 2023 and 2024 is due to increased Rust expertise on the Android team.
</p>
<p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwkwkwfieBcBdcnJ1hyphenhyphenzN3YpbKpZgklKmySAgHablV87Y8zxx5JKuq1bHmMeoKGtFSKdVmttH2aUOgIyn424lKNF8z8BENijo9r687GGPF6k227fnj4eMQ4RTSqLTCysgLAli84iAI9TV6RxUwETfgLfGdsQL0BApI6QQpU_QsZ7Jb4HjBdxNosz3qS3W2/s1600/image4.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiwkwkwfieBcBdcnJ1hyphenhyphenzN3YpbKpZgklKmySAgHablV87Y8zxx5JKuq1bHmMeoKGtFSKdVmttH2aUOgIyn424lKNF8z8BENijo9r687GGPF6k227fnj4eMQ4RTSqLTCysgLAli84iAI9TV6RxUwETfgLfGdsQL0BApI6QQpU_QsZ7Jb4HjBdxNosz3qS3W2/s1600/image4.png" /></a></div>
<p>
While less rework and faster code reviews offer modest productivity gains, the most significant improvements are in the stability and quality of the changes.
</p>
<h2>Stability</h2>


<p>
Stable and high-quality changes differentiate Rust. DORA uses rollback rate for evaluating change stability. Rust's rollback rate is very low and continues to decrease, even as its adoption in Android surpasses C++.
</p>
<p>


<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYEeeQLKTv1uwMOjS0-f87kVn2Zl4a76OBfi1aJJhyphenhyphen8-vgGR7ma84fyNRvWpIFT7VvqNNmgdUmxKh5GKjEhyuSm2krmFq3Q_T9T58XGNHBHqg1DIYRlgXxHoyh6_wpc-9PtrAlBebNZFjcV8gcdCYWgLFv8NZJngPQNp_HJhVvVWVxbD9lNob_i6O-L34m/s1600/image5.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiYEeeQLKTv1uwMOjS0-f87kVn2Zl4a76OBfi1aJJhyphenhyphen8-vgGR7ma84fyNRvWpIFT7VvqNNmgdUmxKh5GKjEhyuSm2krmFq3Q_T9T58XGNHBHqg1DIYRlgXxHoyh6_wpc-9PtrAlBebNZFjcV8gcdCYWgLFv8NZJngPQNp_HJhVvVWVxbD9lNob_i6O-L34m/s1600/image5.png" /></a></div>
<p>
<strong>For medium and large changes, the rollback rate of Rust changes in Android is ~4x lower than C++. </strong>This low rollback rate doesn't just indicate stability; it actively improves overall development throughput. Rollbacks are highly disruptive to productivity, introducing organizational friction and mobilizing resources far beyond the developer who submitted the faulty change. Rollbacks necessitate rework and more code reviews, can also lead to build respins, postmortems, and blockage of other teams. Resulting postmortems often introduce new safeguards that add even more development overhead.</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">self-reported survey from 2022</a>, Google software engineers reported that Rust is both easier to review and more likely to be correct. The hard data on rollback rates and review times validates those impressions.
</p>
<h2>Putting it all together</h2>


<p>
Historically, security improvements often came at a cost. More security meant more process, slower performance, or delayed features, forcing trade-offs between security and other product goals. The shift to Rust is different: we are significantly improving security <em>and</em> key development efficiency and product stability metrics. 
</p>
<h1>Expanding Our Reach</h1>


<p>
With Rust support now mature for building Android system services and libraries, we are focused on bringing its security and productivity advantages elsewhere. 
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Kernel:</strong> Android’s 6.12 Linux kernel is our first kernel with Rust support enabled and our first production Rust driver. More exciting projects are underway, such as our ongoing <a href="https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/introducing-tyr-a-new-rust-drm-driver.html">collaboration with Arm and Collabora on a Rust-based kernel-mode GPU driver</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Firmware:</strong> The combination of high privilege, performance constraints, and limited applicability of many security measures makes firmware both high-risk, and challenging to secure. Moving firmware to Rust can yield a major improvement in security. We have been <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/10/bare-metal-rust-in-android.html">deploying Rust in firmware for years now</a>, and even released <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/09/deploying-rust-in-existing-firmware.html">tutorials</a>, <a href="https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/bare-metal.html">training</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/google/aarch64-rt">code</a> for the wider community. We’re particularly excited about our <a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/blog/rf-a-blog">collaboration with Arm on Rusted Firmware-A</a>.</li>

<li><strong>First-party applications:</strong> Rust is ensuring memory safety from the ground up in several security-critical Google applications, such as:</li> 
<ul>
 
<li><a href="https://developers.google.com/nearby">Nearby Presence</a>: The protocol for securely and privately discovering local devices over Bluetooth is implemented in Rust and is currently running in Google Play Services.</li>
 
<li><a href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/article/rcs-encryption-a-leap-towards-secure-and-interoperable-messaging/">MLS</a>: The protocol for secure RCS messaging is implemented in Rust and will be included in the Google Messages app in a future release.</li>
 
<li>Chromium: Parsers for <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/6085801">PNG</a>, <a href="https://crbug.com/40276029">JSON</a>, and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/memory-safety-fonts">web fonts</a> have been replaced with memory-safe implementations in Rust, making it easier for Chromium engineers to deal with data from the web while following the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md">Rule of 2</a>.</li> 
</ul></li> 
</ul>
<p>
<br />These examples highlight Rust's role in reducing security risks, but <strong>memory-safe languages are only one part of a comprehensive memory safety strategy</strong>. We continue to employ a defense-in-depth approach, the value of which was clearly demonstrated in a recent near-miss.
</p>
<h1>Our First Rust Memory Safety Vulnerability...Almost</h1>


<p>
We recently avoided shipping our very first Rust-based memory safety vulnerability: a linear buffer overflow in <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/rust/crabbyavif/">CrabbyAVIF</a>. It was a near-miss. To ensure <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/rust/crabbyavif/+/5262cd9befecb4f8865925c23eb543f19967e050">the patch</a> received high priority and was tracked through release channels, we assigned it the identifier <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-08-01">CVE-2025-48530</a>. While it’s great that <strong>the vulnerability never made it into a public release</strong>, the near-miss offers valuable lessons. The following sections highlight key takeaways from our postmortem.
</p>
<h2>Scudo Hardened Allocator for the Win</h2>


<p>
A key finding is that <strong>Android’s Scudo hardened allocator deterministically rendered this vulnerability non-exploitable</strong> <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/ScudoHardenedAllocator.html">due to guard pages surrounding secondary allocations</a>. While Scudo is Android’s default allocator, used on Google Pixel and many other devices, we continue to work with partners to make it mandatory. In the meantime, we will issue CVEs of sufficient severity for vulnerabilities that could be prevented by Scudo.
</p>
<p>
In addition to protecting against overflows, Scudo’s use of guard pages helped identify this issue by changing an overflow from silent memory corruption into a noisy crash. However, we did discover a gap in our crash reporting: it failed to clearly show that the crash was a result of an overflow, which slowed down triage and response. This has been fixed, and we now have a clear signal when overflows occur into Scudo guard pages.
</p>
<h2>Unsafe Review and Training</h2>


<p>
Operating system development requires unsafe code, typically C, C++, or unsafe Rust  (for example, for FFI and interacting with hardware), so simply banning unsafe code is not workable. When developers must use unsafe, they should understand how to do so soundly and responsibly
</p>
<p>
To that end, we are adding a new deep dive on unsafe code to our <a href="https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/">Comprehensive Rust training</a>. This new module, currently in development, aims to teach developers how to reason about unsafe Rust code, soundness and undefined behavior, as well as best practices like safety comments and encapsulating unsafe code in safe abstractions.
</p>
<p>
Better understanding of unsafe Rust will lead to even higher quality and more secure code across the open source software ecosystem and within Android. As we'll discuss in the next section, our unsafe Rust is already really quite safe. It’s exciting to consider just how high the bar can go.
</p>
<h1>Comparing Vulnerability Densities</h1>


<p>
This near-miss inevitably raises the question: "If Rust can have memory safety vulnerabilities, then what’s the point?"
</p>
<p>
The point is that the density is drastically lower. So much lower that it represents a major shift in security posture. Based on our near-miss, we can make a conservative estimate. With roughly 5 million lines of Rust in the Android platform and one potential memory safety vulnerability found (and fixed pre-release), our estimated vulnerability density for Rust is 0.2 vuln per 1 million lines (MLOC).
</p>
<p>
Our historical data for C and C++ shows a density of closer to 1,000 memory safety vulnerabilities per MLOC. Our Rust code is currently tracking at a density orders of magnitude lower: <strong>a more than 1000x reduction.</strong>
</p>
<p>
Memory safety rightfully receives significant focus because the vulnerability class is uniquely powerful and (historically) highly prevalent. High vulnerability density undermines otherwise solid security design because these flaws can be chained to bypass defenses, including those specifically targeting memory safety exploits. Significantly lowering vulnerability density does not just reduce the number of bugs; it dramatically boosts the effectiveness of our entire security architecture.
</p>
<p>
The primary security concern regarding Rust generally centers on the approximately 4% of code written within <code>unsafe{}</code> blocks. This subset of Rust has fueled significant speculation, misconceptions, and even theories that <a href="https://goto.ucsd.edu/~rjhala/hotos-ffi.pdf">unsafe Rust might be more buggy than C</a>. Empirical evidence shows this to be quite wrong.
</p>
<p>
Our data indicates that even a more conservative assumption, that a line of unsafe Rust is as likely to have a bug as a line of C or C++, significantly overestimates the risk of unsafe Rust. We don’t know for sure why this is the case, but there are likely several contributing factors:
</p>
<ul>

<li>unsafe{} doesn't actually disable all or even most of Rust’s safety checks (a common misconception).</li>

<li>The practice of encapsulation enables local reasoning about safety invariants.</li>

<li>The additional scrutiny that unsafe{} blocks receive.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>


<p>
Historically, we had to accept a trade-off: mitigating the risks of memory safety defects required substantial investments in static analysis, runtime mitigations, sandboxing, and reactive patching. This approach attempted to move fast and then pick up the pieces afterwards. These layered protections were essential, but they came at a high cost to performance and developer productivity, while still providing insufficient assurance.
</p>
<p>
While C and C++ will persist, and both software and hardware safety mechanisms remain critical for layered defense, the transition to Rust is a different approach where the more secure path is also demonstrably more efficient. Instead of moving fast and <em>then</em> later fixing the mess, we can move faster <em>while</em> fixing things. And who knows, as our code gets increasingly safe, perhaps we can start to reclaim even more of that performance and productivity that we exchanged for security, all while also <em>improving</em> security.

<p>From the vantage point of today, it&#8217;s surreal reading about the commercial cryptography business in the 1970s. Nobody knew anything.

### [Building checksec without boundaries with Checksec Anywhere](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/11/13/building-checksec-without-boundaries-with-checksec-anywhere/) - November 13, 2025

<p>Since its original release in 2009, <a href="https://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec/">checksec</a> has become widely used in the software security community, proving useful in CTF challenges, security posturing, and general binary analysis. The tool inspects executables to determine which exploit mitigations (e.g., ASLR, DEP, stack canaries, etc.) are enabled, rapidly gauging a program’s defensive hardening. This success inspired numerous spinoffs: a <a href="https://github.com/slimm609/checksec">contemporary Go implementation</a>, Trail of Bits&rsquo; <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/winchecksec">Winchecksec</a> for PE binaries, and various scripts targeting Apple’s Mach-O binary format. However, this created an unwieldy ecosystem where security professionals must juggle multiple tools, each with different interfaces, dependencies, and feature sets.</p>
<p>During my summer internship at Trail of Bits, I built <a href="https://checksec-anywhere.com/">Checksec Anywhere</a> to consolidate this fragmented ecosystem into a consistent and accessible platform. Checksec Anywhere brings ELF, PE, and Mach-O analysis directly to your browser. It runs completely locally: no accounts, no uploads, no downloads. It is fast (analyzes thousands of binaries in seconds) and private, and lets you share results with a simple URL.</p>
<h2 id="using-checksec-anywhere">Using Checksec Anywhere</h2>
<p>To use Checksec Anywhere, just drag and drop a file or folder directly into the browser. Results are instantly displayed with color-coded messages reflecting finding severity. All processing happens locally in your browser; at no point is data sent to Trail of Bits or anyone else.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 id="key-features-of-checksec-anywhere">Key features of Checksec Anywhere</h2>
<h3 id="multi-format-analysis">Multi-format analysis</h3>
<p>Checksec Anywhere performs comprehensive binary analysis across ELF, PE, and Mach-O formats from a single interface, providing analysis tailored to each platform&rsquo;s unique security mechanisms. This includes traditional checks like stack canaries and PIE for ELF binaries, GS cookies and Control Flow Guard for PE files, and ARC and code signing for Mach-O executables. For users familiar with the traditional checksec family of tools, Checksec Anywhere reports maintain consistency with prior reporting nomenclature.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-first">Privacy-first</h3>
<p>Unlike many browser-accessible tools that simply provide a web interface to server-side processing, Checksec Anywhere ensures that your binaries never leave your machine by performing all analysis directly in the browser. Report generation also happens locally, and shareable links do not reveal binary content.</p>
<h3 id="performance-by-design">Performance by design</h3>
<p>From browser upload to complete security report, Checksec Anywhere is designed to rapidly process multiple files. Since Checksec Anywhere runs locally, the exact performance depends on your machine… but it&rsquo;s fast. On a modern MacBook Pro it can analyze thousands of files in mere seconds.</p>
<h3 id="enhanced-accessibility">Enhanced accessibility</h3>
<p>Checksec Anywhere eliminates installation barriers by offering an entirely browser-based interface and features designed to provide accessibility:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Shareable results</strong>: Generate static URLs for any report view, enabling secure collaboration without exposing binaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SARIF export</strong>: Generate reports in SARIF format for integration with CI/CD pipelines and other security tools. These reports are also generated entirely on your local machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Simple batch processing</strong>: Drag and drop entire directories for simple bulk analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tabbed interface</strong>: Manage multiple analyses simultaneously with an intuitive UI.</p>
<p>

 <figcaption>Figure 2: Tabbed interface for managing multiple analyses</figcaption>
 </figure>

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="technical-architecture">Technical architecture</h3>
<p>Checksec Anywhere leverages modern web technologies to deliver native-tool performance in the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rust core</strong>: Checksec Anywhere is built on the <a href="https://github.com/etke/checksec.rs">checksec.rs</a> foundation, using well-established crates like Goblin for binary parsing and iced_x86 for disassembly.</li>
<li><strong>WebAssembly bridge</strong>: The Rust code is compiled to Wasm using wasm-pack, exposing low-level functionality through a clean JavaScript API.</li>
<li><strong>Extensible design</strong>: Per-format processing architecture allows easy addition of new binary types and security checks.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced analysis</strong>: Checksec Anywhere performs disassembly to enable deeper introspection (like to detect stack protection in PE binaries).</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/checksec-anywhere">open-source codebase</a> to dig further into its architecture.</p>
<h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2>
<p>With an established infrastructure for cross-platform binary analysis and reporting, we can easily add new features and extensions. If you have pull requests, we’d love to review and merge them.</p>
<h3 id="additional-formats">Additional formats</h3>
<p>A current major blind spot is lack of support for mobile binary formats like Android APK and iOS IPA. Adding analysis for these formats would address the expanding mobile threat landscape. Similarly, specialized handling of firmware binaries and bootloaders would extend coverage to critical system-level components in mobile and embedded devices.</p>
<h3 id="additional-security-properties">Additional security properties</h3>
<p>Checksec Anywhere is designed to add new checks as researchers discover new attack methods. For example, recent research has uncovered multiple mechanisms by which compiler optimizations violate constant-time execution guarantees, prompting significant discussion within the compiler community (see <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-constant-time-execution-guarantees-in-llvm/86700">this LLVM discourse thread</a>, for example). As these issues are addressed, constant-time security checks can be integrated into Checksec Anywhere, providing immediate feedback on whether a given binary is resistant to timing attacks.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out</h2>
<p>Checksec Anywhere eliminates the overhead of managing format-specific security analysis tools while providing immediate access to comprehensive binary security reports. No installation, no dependencies, no compromises on privacy or performance. Visit <a href="http://checksec-anywhere.com">checksec-anywhere.com</a> and try it now!</p>
<p>I’d like to extend a special thank you to my mentors William Woodruff and Bradley Swain for their guidance and support throughout my summer here at Trail of Bits!</p>
