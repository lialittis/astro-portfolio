### [CISA Adds Actively Exploited XSS Bug CVE-2021-26829 in OpenPLC ScadaBR to KEV](https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/cisa-adds-actively-exploited-xss-bug.html) - November 30, 2025

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has updated its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog to include a security flaw impacting OpenPLC ScadaBR, citing evidence of active exploitation.
The vulnerability in question is CVE-2021-26829 (CVSS score: 5.4), a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw that affects Windows and Linux versions of the software via

### [Legacy Python Bootstrap Scripts Create Domain-Takeover Risk in Multiple PyPI Packages](https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/legacy-python-bootstrap-scripts-create.html) - November 28, 2025

Cybersecurity researchers have discovered vulnerable code in legacy Python packages that could potentially pave the way for a supply chain compromise on the Python Package Index (PyPI) via a domain takeover attack.
Software supply chain security company ReversingLabs said it found the "vulnerability" in bootstrap files provided by a build and deployment automation tool named "zc.buildout."

### [Prompt Injection Through Poetry](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/prompt-injection-through-poetry.html) - November 28, 2025

<p>In a new paper, &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15304">Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models</a>,&#8221; researchers found that turning LLM prompts into poetry resulted in jailbreaking the models:</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: We present evidence that adversarial poetry functions as a universal single-turn jailbreak technique for Large Language Models (LLMs). Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 ML-Commons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of 3 open-weight LLM judges, whose binary safety assessments were validated on a stratified human-labeled subset. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols...</p></blockquote>

### [MS Teams Guest Access Can Remove Defender Protection When Users Join External Tenants](https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/ms-teams-guest-access-can-remove.html) - November 28, 2025

Cybersecurity researchers have shed light on a cross-tenant blind spot that allows attackers to bypass Microsoft Defender for Office 365 protections via the guest access feature in Teams.
"When users operate as guests in another tenant, their protections are determined entirely by that hosting environment, not by their home organization," Ontinue security researcher Rhys Downing said in a report
