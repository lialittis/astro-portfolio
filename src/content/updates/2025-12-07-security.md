### [Friday Squid Blogging: Vampire Squid Genome](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/friday-squid-blogging-vampire-squid-genome.html) - December 05, 2025

<p>The vampire squid (<i>Vampyroteuthis infernalis</i>) has the <a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vampire-squid-from-hell-reveals-the-ancient-origins-of-octopuses">largest cephalopod genome</a> ever sequenced: more than 11 billion base pairs. That&#8217;s more than twice as large as the biggest squid genomes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s technically not a squid: &#8220;The vampire squid is a fascinating twig tenaciously hanging onto the cephalopod family tree. It&#8217;s neither a squid nor an octopus (nor a vampire), but rather the last, lone remnant of an ancient lineage whose other members have long since vanished.&#8221;</p>
<p>As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven&#8217;t covered...</p>
