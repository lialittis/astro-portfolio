<p>The promise of personal AI assistants rests on a dangerous assumption: that we can trust systems we haven’t made trustworthy. We can’t. And today’s versions are failing us in predictable ways: pushing us to do things against our own best interests, gaslighting us with doubt about things we are or that we know, and being unable to distinguish between who we are and who we have been. They struggle with incomplete, inaccurate, and partial context: with no standard way to move toward accuracy, no mechanism to correct sources of error, and no accountability when wrong information leads to bad decisions...</p>

### [Catching malicious package releases using a transparency log](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/12/12/catching-malicious-package-releases-using-a-transparency-log/) - December 12, 2025

<p>We’re getting Sigstore’s <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor">rekor-monitor</a> ready for production use, making it easier for developers to detect tampering and unauthorized uses of their identities in the <a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/">Rekor</a> transparency log. This work, funded by the <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a>, includes support for the new <a href="https://blog.sigstore.dev/rekor-v2-ga/">Rekor v2 log</a>, certificate validation, and integration with The Update Framework (TUF).</p>
<p>For package maintainers that publish attestations signed using Sigstore (as supported by <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/attestations/producing-attestations/">PyPI</a> and <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements">npm</a>), monitoring the Rekor log can help them quickly become aware of a compromise of their release process by notifying them of new signing events related to the package they maintain.</p>
<p>Transparency logs like Rekor provide a critical security function: they create append-only, tamper-evident records that are easy to monitor. But having entries in a log doesn’t mean that they’re trustworthy by default. A compromised identity could be used to sign metadata, with the malicious entry recorded in the log. By improving rekor-monitor, we’re making it easy for everyone to actively monitor for unexpected log entries.</p>
<h2 id="why-transparency-logs-matter">Why transparency logs matter</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re adding a dependency to your Go project. You run <code>go get</code>, the dependency is downloaded, and its digest is calculated and added to your <code>go.sum</code> file to ensure that future downloads have the same digest, trusting that first download as the source of truth. But what if the download was compromised?</p>
<p>What you need is a way of verifying that the digest corresponds to the exact dependency you want to download. A central database that contains all artifacts and their digests seems useful: the <code>go get</code> command could query the database for the artifact, and see if the digests match. However, a normal database can be tampered with by internal or external malicious actors, meaning the problem of trust is still not solved: instead of trusting the first download of the artifact, now the user needs to trust the database.</p>
<p>This is where transparency logs come in: logs where entries can only be added (append-only), any changes to existing entries can be trivially detected (tamper-evident), and new entries can be easily monitored. This is how <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database">Go’s checksum database works: it stores</a> the digests of all Go modules as entries in a transparency log, which is used as the source of truth for artifact digests. Users don’t need to trust the log, since it is continuously checked and monitored by independent parties.</p>
<p>In practice, this means that an attacker cannot modify an existing entry without the change being detectable by external parties (usually called “witnesses” in this context). Furthermore, if an attacker releases a malicious version of a Go module, the corresponding entry that is added to the log cannot be hidden, deleted or modified. This means module maintainers can continuously monitor the log for new entries containing their module name, and get immediate alerts if an unexpected version is added.</p>
<p>While a compromised release process usually leaves traces (such as GitHub releases, git tags, or CI/CD logs), these can be hidden or obfuscated. In addition, becoming aware of the compromise requires someone noticing these traces, which might take a long time. By proactively monitoring a transparency log, maintainers can very quickly be notified of compromises of their signing identity.</p>
<p>Transparency logs, such as <a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/">Rekor</a> and <a href="https://go.dev/ref/mod#checksum-database">Go’s checksum database</a>, are based on Merkle trees, a data structure that makes it easy to cryptographically verify that has not been tampered with. For a good visual introduction of how this works at the data structure level, see <a href="https://research.swtch.com/tlog">Transparent Logs for Skeptical Clients</a>.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-a-transparency-log">Monitoring a transparency log</h2>
<p>Having an entry in a transparency log does not make it trustworthy by default. As we just discussed, an attacker might release a new (malicious) Go package and have its associated checksum added to the log. The log’s strength is not preventing unexpected/malicious data from being added, but rather being able to monitor the log for unexpected entries. If new entries are not monitored, the security benefits of using a log are greatly reduced.</p>
<p>This is why making it easy for users to monitor the log is important: people can immediately be alerted when something unexpected is added to the log and take immediate action. That’s why, thanks to funding by the <a href="https://openssf.org/">OpenSSF</a>, we’ve been working on getting Sigstore’s <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor">rekor-monitor</a> ready for production use.</p>
<p>The Sigstore ecosystem uses <a href="https://docs.sigstore.dev/logging/overview/">Rekor</a> to log entries related to, for example, the <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2024/11/14/attestations-a-new-generation-of-signatures-on-pypi/">attestations for Python packages</a>. Once an attestation is signed, a new entry is added to Rekor that contains information about the signing event: the CI/CD workflow that initiated it, the associated repository identity, and more. By having this information in Rekor, users can <a href="https://search.sigstore.dev/?logIndex=243090039">query the log</a> and have certain guarantees that it has not been tampered with.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor">rekor-monitor</a> allows users to monitor the log to ensure that existing entries have not been tampered with, and to monitor new entries for unexpected uses of their identity. For example, the maintainer of a Python package that uploads packages from their GitHub repository (via <a href="https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/">Trusted Publishing</a>) can monitor the log for any new entries that use the repository’s identity. In case of compromise, the maintainer would get a notification that their identity was used to upload a package to PyPI, allowing them to react quickly to the compromise instead of relying on waiting for someone to notice the compromise.</p>
<p>As part of our work in rekor-monitor, we’ve added support for the new <a href="https://blog.sigstore.dev/rekor-v2-ga/">Rekor v2 log</a>, implemented certificate validation against trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) to allow users to better filter log entries, added support for fetching the log’s public keys using <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/">TUF</a>, solved outstanding issues to make the system more reliable, and made the associated GitHub reusable workflow ready for use. This last item allows anyone to monitor the log via the <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor?tab=readme-ov-file#github-workflow-setup">provided reusable workflow</a>, lowering the barrier of entry so that anyone with a GitHub repository can run their own monitor.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<p>A next step would be a hosted service that allows users to subscribe for alerts when a new entry containing relevant information (such as their identity) is added. This could work similarly to <a href="https://www.gopherwatch.org/">GopherWatch</a>, where users can subscribe to notifications for when a new version of a Go module is uploaded.</p>
<p>A hosted service with a user-friendly frontend for rekor-monitor would reduce the barrier of entry even further: instead of setting up their own monitor, users can subscribe for notifications using a simple web form and get alerts for unexpected uses of their identity in the transparency log.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the Sigstore maintainers, particularly Hayden Blauzvern and Mihai Maruseac, for reviewing our work and for their invaluable feedback during the development process. Our development on this project is part of our ongoing work on the Sigstore ecosystem, as funded by OpenSSF, whose mission is to inspire and enable the community to secure the open source software we all depend on.</p>

### [AIs Exploiting Smart Contracts](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/ais-exploiting-smart-contracts.html) - December 11, 2025

<p>I have long maintained that smart contracts are a dumb idea: that a human process is actually a security feature.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2025/smart-contracts/">interesting research</a> on training AIs to automatically exploit smart contracts:</p>
<blockquote><p>AI models are increasingly good at cyber tasks, as we&#8217;ve <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2025/ai-for-cyber-defenders/">written about before</a>. But what is the economic impact of these capabilities? In a recent <a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/">MATS</a> and Anthropic Fellows project, our scholars investigated this question by evaluating AI agents&#8217; ability to exploit smart contracts on <a href="https://github.com/safety-research/SmartContract-bench">Smart CONtracts Exploitation benchmark (SCONE-bench)</a>­a new benchmark they built comprising 405 contracts that were actually exploited between 2020 and 2025. On contracts exploited after the latest knowledge cutoffs (June 2025 for Opus 4.5 and March 2025 for other models), Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5 developed exploits collectively worth $4.6 million, establishing a concrete lower bound for the economic harm these capabilities could enable. Going beyond retrospective analysis, we evaluated both Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 in simulation against 2,849 recently deployed contracts without any known vulnerabilities. Both agents uncovered two novel zero-day vulnerabilities and produced exploits worth $3,694, with GPT-5 doing so at an API cost of $3,476. This demonstrates as a proof-of-concept that profitable, real-world autonomous exploitation is technically feasible, a finding that underscores the need for proactive adoption of AI for defense...</p></blockquote>

<p>In 2023 GitHub introduced CodeQL <a href="https://github.blog/security/vulnerability-research/multi-repository-variant-analysis-a-powerful-new-way-to-perform-security-research-across-github/">multi-repository variant analysis</a> (MRVA). This functionality lets you run queries across thousands of projects using pre-built databases and drastically reduces the time needed to find security bugs at scale. There’s just one problem: it’s largely built on <a href="https://github.com/github/vscode-codeql">VS Code</a> and I’m a Vim user and a terminal junkie. That’s why I built <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/mrva"><code>mrva</code></a>, a composable, terminal-first alternative that runs entirely on your machine and outputs results wherever <code>stdout</code> leads you.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover installing and using <code>mrva</code>, compare its feature set to GitHub’s MRVA functionality, and discuss a few interesting implementation details I discovered while working on it. Here is a quick example of what you’ll see at the end of your <code>mrva</code> journey:</p>

</p>
<h2 id="installing-and-running-mrva">Installing and running mrva</h2>
<p>First, install <code>mrva</code> from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mrva/">PyPI</a>:</p>
<p><code>$ python -m pip install mrva</code></p>
<p><em>Or, use your favorite Python package installer like <code>pipx</code> or <code>uv</code>.</em></p>
<p>Running <code>mrva</code> can be broken down into roughly three steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download pre-built CodeQL databases from the GitHub API (<code>mrva download</code>).</li>
<li>Analyze the databases with CodeQL queries or packs (<code>mrva analyze</code>).</li>
<li>Output the results to the terminal (<code>mrva pprint</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s run the tool with Trail of Bits’ <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/codeql-queries">public CodeQL queries</a>. Start by downloading the top 1,000 Go project databases:</p>
<figure class="highlight">
 <pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ mkdir databases
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ mrva download --token YOUR_GH_PAT --language go databases/ top --limit 1000

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">...</span></span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>You can also use the <code>$GITHUB_TOKEN</code> environment variable to more securely specify your personal access token. Additionally, there are other strategies for downloading CodeQL databases, such as by GitHub organization (<code>download org</code>) or a single repository (<code>download repo</code>). From here, let’s clone the queries and run the multi-repo variant analysis:</p>
<figure class="highlight">
 <pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/codeql-queries.git
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ mrva analyze databases/ codeql-queries/go/src/crypto/ -- --rerun --threads=0

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">...</span></span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>This analysis may take quite some time depending on your database corpus size, query count, query complexity, and machine hardware. You can filter the databases being analyzed by passing the <code>--select</code> or <code>--ignore</code> flag to <code>analyze</code>. Any flags passed after <code>--</code> will be sent directly to the CodeQL binary. Note that, instead of having <code>mrva</code> parallelize multiple CodeQL analyses, we instead recommend passing <code>--threads=0</code> and letting CodeQL handle parallelization. This helps avoid CPU thrashing between the parent and child processes. Once the analysis is done, you can print the results:</p>

<p>This finding is a false positive because the message is indeed being truncated, but updating <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/codeql-queries/blob/main/go/src/crypto/MsgNotHashedBeforeSigVerfication/MsgNotHashedBeforeSigVerfication.ql">the query’s</a> list of <a href="https://codeql.github.com/codeql-standard-libraries/go/semmle/go/security/IncorrectIntegerConversionLib.qll/predicate.IncorrectIntegerConversionLib$ConversionWithoutBoundsCheckConfig$isBarrier.2.html">barriers</a> is beyond the scope of this post. Like previous commands, <code>pprint</code> also takes a number of flags that can affect its output. Run it with <code>--help</code> to see what is available.</p>
<p>A quick side note: <code>pprint</code> is also capable of pretty-printing SARIF results from non-<code>mrva</code> CodeQL analyses. That is, it solves one of my first and biggest gripes with CodeQL: why can’t I get the output of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-cli/codeql-cli-manual/database-analyze"><code>database analyze</code></a> in a human readable form? It’s especially useful if you run <code>analyze</code> with the <code>--sarif-add-file-contents</code> flag. Outputting CSV and SARIF is great for machines, but often I just want to see the results then and there in the terminal. <code>mrva</code> solves this problem.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-mrva-with-github-tooling">Comparing mrva with GitHub tooling</h2>
<p><code>mrva</code> takes a lot of inspiration from GitHub’s CodeQL VS Code extension. GitHub also provides an unofficial CLI extension <a href="https://github.com/GitHubSecurityLab/gh-mrva">by the same name</a>. However, as we’ll see, this extension replicates many of the same cloud-first workflows as the VS Code extension rather than running everything locally. Here is a summary of these three implementations:</p>

<p>As you can see, the primary benefits of <code>mrva</code> are the ability to run analyses and view findings locally. This gives the user more control over analysis options and ownership of their findings data. Everything is just a file on disk—where you take it from there is up to you.</p>
<h2 id="interesting-implementation-details">Interesting implementation details</h2>
<p>After working on a new project I generally like to share a few interesting implementation details I learned along the way. This can help demystify a completed task, provide useful crumbs for others to go in a different direction, or simply highlight something unusual. There were three details I found particularly interesting while working on this project:</p>
<ol>
<li>The GitHub CodeQL database API</li>
<li>Useful <code>database analyze</code> flags</li>
<li>Different kinds of CodeQL queries</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="codeql-database-api">CodeQL database API</h3>
<p>Even though <code>mrva</code> runs its <em>analyses</em> locally, it depends heavily on GitHub’s pre-built CodeQL databases. Building CodeQL databases can be time consuming and error-prone, which is why it’s so great that GitHub provides <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/code-scanning/code-scanning?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-codeql-database-for-a-repository">this API</a>. Many of the largest open-source repositories automatically build and provide a corresponding database. Whether your target repositories are public or private, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/enabling-code-scanning/configuring-default-setup-for-code-scanning#configuring-code-scanning-automatically">configure code scanning</a> to enable this functionality.</p>
<p>From Trail of Bits’ perspective, this is helpful when we’re on a client audit because we can easily download a single repository’s database (<code>mrva download repo</code>) or an entire GitHub organization’s (<code>mrva download org</code>). We can then run our custom CodeQL queries against these databases without having to waste time building them ourselves. This functionality is also useful for testing experimental queries against a large corpus of open-source code. Providing a CodeQL database API allows us to move faster and more accurately, and provides security researchers with a testing playground.</p>
<h3 id="analyze-flags">Analyze flags</h3>
<p>While I was working on <code>mrva</code>, another group of features I found useful was the wide variety of flags that can be passed to <code>database analyze</code>, especially regarding SARIF output. One in particular stood out: <code>--sarif-add-file-contents</code>. This flag includes the file contents in the SARIF output so you can cross-reference a finding’s file location with the actual lines of code. This was critical for implementing the <code>mrva pprint</code> functionality and avoiding having to independently manage a source code checkout for code lookups.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <code>--sarif-add-snippets</code> flag provides two lines of context instead of the entire file. This can be beneficial if SARIF file size is a concern. Another useful flag in certain situations is <code>--no-group-results</code>. This flag provides one result per message instead of per unique location. It can be helpful when you’re trying to understand the number of results that coalesce on a single location or the different types of queries that may end up on a single line of code. This flag and others can be passed directly to CodeQL when running an <code>mrva</code> analysis by specifying it after double dashes like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight">
 <pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ mrva analyze &lt;db_dir&gt; &lt;queries&gt; -- --no-group-results ...</span></span></code></pre>
</figure>
<h3 id="codeql-query-kinds">CodeQL query kinds</h3>
<p>When working with CodeQL, you will quickly find two common kinds of queries: alert queries (<code>@kind problem</code>) and path queries (<code>@kind path-problem</code>). Alert queries use basic <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/defining-the-results-of-a-query/"><code>select</code> statements</a> for querying code, like you might expect to see in a SQL query. Path queries are used for <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/writing-codeql-queries/about-data-flow-analysis/#normal-data-flow-vs-taint-tracking">data flow or taint tracking</a> analysis. Path results form a series of code locations that progress from source to sink and represent a path through the control flow or data flow graph. To that end, these two types of queries also have different representations in the SARIF output. For example, alert queries use a result’s <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc141790900"><code>location</code> property</a>, while path queries use the <a href="https://docs.oasis-open.org/sarif/sarif/v2.1.0/errata01/os/sarif-v2.1.0-errata01-os-complete.html#_Toc141790906"><code>codeFlows</code> property</a>. Despite their infrequent usage, CodeQL also supports other kinds of queries.</p>
<p>You can also create diagnostic queries (<a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agithub%2Fcodeql+%22%40kind+diagnostic%22&amp;type=code"><code>@kind diagnostic</code></a>) and summary queries (<a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agithub%2Fcodeql+%22%40kind+metric%22+%22%40tags+summary%22&amp;type=code"><code>@kind metric</code></a>). As their names suggest, these kinds of queries are helpful for producing telemetry and logging information. Perhaps the most interesting kind of query is graph queries (<a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agithub%2Fcodeql+%22%40kind+graph%22&amp;type=code"><code>@kind graph</code></a>). This kind of query is used in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/codeql-for-vs-code/using-the-advanced-functionality-of-the-codeql-for-vs-code-extension/exploring-the-structure-of-your-source-code#viewing-the-abstract-syntax-tree-of-a-source-file"><code>printAST.ql</code></a> functionality, which will output a code file’s abstract syntax tree (AST) when run alongside other queries. I’ve found this functionality to be invaluable when debugging my own custom queries. <code>mrva</code> currently has experimental support for printing AST information, and we have <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/mrva/issues/3">an issue</a> for tracking improvements to this functionality.</p>
<p>I suspect there are many more interesting types of analyses that could be done with graph queries, and it’s something I’m excited to dig into in the future. For example, CodeQL can also output <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGML">Directed Graph Markup Language</a> (DGML) or <a href="https://graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html">Graphviz DOT language</a> when running graph queries. This could provide a great way to visualize data flow or control flow graphs when examining code.</p>
<h2 id="running-at-scale-locally">Running at scale, locally</h2>
<p>As a Vim user with VS Code envy, I set out to build <code>mrva</code> to provide flexibility for those of us living in the terminal. I’m also in the fortunate position that Trail of Bits provides us with hefty laptops that can quickly chew through static analysis jobs, so running complex queries against thousands of projects is doable locally. A terminal-first approach also enables running headless and/or scheduled multi-repo variant analyses if you’d like to, for example, incorporate <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/08/08/buttercup-is-now-open-source/">automated bug finding</a> into your research. Finally, we often have sensitive data privacy needs that require us to run jobs locally and not send data to the cloud.</p>
<p>I’ve heard it said that writing CodeQL queries requires a PhD in program analysis. Now, I’m not a doctor, but there are times when I’m working on a query and it feels that way. However, CodeQL is one of those tools where the deeper you dig, the more you will find, almost to limitless depth. For this reason, I’ve really enjoyed learning more about CodeQL and I’m looking forward to going deeper in the future. Despite my apprehension toward VS Code, none of this would be possible without GitHub and Microsoft, so I appreciate their investment in this tooling. The CodeQL database API, rich standard library of queries, and, of course, the tool itself make all of this possible.</p>

### [HTTPS certificate industry phasing out less secure domain validation methods](http://security.googleblog.com/2025/12/https-certificate-industry-phasing-out.html) - December 10, 2025

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Chrome Root Program Team </span>

<p>
Secure connections are the backbone of the modern web, but a certificate is only as trustworthy as the validation process and issuance practices behind it. Recently, the <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/how-chrome-root-program-keeps-users-safe.html">Chrome Root Program</a> and the <a href="https://cabforum.org/">CA/Browser Forum</a> have taken decisive steps toward a more secure internet by adopting new security requirements for HTTPS certificate issuers.
</p>
<p>
These initiatives, driven by Ballots <a href="https://cabforum.org/2024/11/14/ballot-sc080v3-sunset-the-use-of-whois-to-identify-domain-contacts-and-relying-dcv-methods/">SC-080</a>, <a href="https://cabforum.org/2025/11/20/ballot-sc-090-gradually-sunset-all-remaining-email-based-phone-based-and-crossover-validation-methods-from-sections-3.2.2.4-and-3.2.2.5/">SC-090</a>, and <a href="https://cabforum.org/2025/11/12/ballot-sc-091-sunset-3.2.2.5.3-reverse-address-lookup-validation-proposal-of-new-dns-based-validation-using-persistent-dcv-txt-record-for-ip-addresses/">SC-091</a>, will sunset 11 legacy methods for Domain Control Validation. By retiring these outdated practices, which rely on weaker verification signals like physical mail, phone calls, or emails, we are closing potential loopholes for attackers and pushing the ecosystem toward automated, cryptographically verifiable security.
</p>
<p>
To allow affected website operators to transition smoothly, the deprecation will be phased in, with its full security value realized by March 2028.
</p>
<p>
This effort is a key part of our public roadmap, “<a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">Moving Forward, Together,</a>” launched in 2022. Our vision is to improve security by modernizing infrastructure and promoting agility through automation. While "Moving Forward, Together" sets the aspirational direction, the recent updates to the <a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/">TLS Baseline Requirements</a> turn that vision into policy. This builds on our momentum from earlier this year, including the successful <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/03/new-security-requirements-adopted-by.html">advocacy for the adoption of other security enhancing initiatives</a> as industry-wide standards.
</p>
<p>
<strong>What’s Domain Control Validation?</strong>
</p>
<p>
Domain Control Validation is a security-critical process designed to ensure certificates are only issued to the legitimate domain operator. This prevents unauthorized entities from obtaining a certificate for a domain they do not control. Without this check, an attacker could obtain a valid certificate for a legitimate website and use it to impersonate that site or intercept web traffic.
</p>
<p>
Before issuing a certificate, a Certification Authority (CA) must verify that the requestor legitimately controls the domain. Most modern validation relies on “challenge-response” mechanisms, for example, a CA might provide a random value for the requestor to place in a specific location, like a DNS TXT record, which the CA then verifies. 
</p>
<p>
Historically, other methods validated control through indirect means, such as looking up contact information in WHOIS records or sending an email to a domain contact. These methods have been proven vulnerable (<a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/we-spent-20-to-achieve-rce-and-accidentally-became-the-admins-of-mobi/">example</a>) and the recent efforts retire these weaker checks in favor of robust, automated alternatives. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Raising the floor of security</strong>
</p>
<p>
The recently passed CA/Browser Forum Server Certificate Working Group Ballots introduce a phased sunset of the following Domain Control Validation methods. Alternative existing methods offer stronger security assurances against attackers trying to obtain fraudulent certificates – and the alternative methods are getting <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/03/new-security-requirements-adopted-by.html">stronger</a> over time, too.
</p>
<p>
Sunsetted methods relying on email:
</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#32242-email-fax-sms-or-postal-mail-to-domain-contact">Email, Fax, SMS, or Postal Mail to Domain Contact</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#32252-email-fax-sms-or-postal-mail-to-ip-address-contact">Email, Fax, SMS, or Postal Mail to IP Address Contact</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#32244-constructed-email-to-domain-contact">Constructed Email to Domain Contact</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#322413-email-to-dns-caa-contact">Email to DNS CAA Contact</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#322414-email-to-dns-txt-contact">Email to DNS TXT Contact</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Sunsetted methods relying on phone: 
</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#32243-phone-contact-with-domain-contact">Phone Contact with Domain Contact</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#322416-phone-contact-with-dns-txt-record-phone-contact">Phone Contact with DNS TXT Record Phone Contact</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#322417-phone-contact-with-dns-caa-phone-contact">Phone Contact with DNS CAA Phone Contact</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#32255-phone-contact-with-ip-address-contact">Phone Contact with IP Address Contact</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Sunsetted method relying on a reverse lookup:
</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#32248-ip-address">IP Address</a></li>

<li><a href="https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#32253-reverse-address-lookup">Reverse Address Lookup</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
For everyday users, these changes are invisible - and that’s the point. But, behind the scenes, they make it harder for attackers to trick a CA into issuing a certificate for a domain they don’t control. This reduces the risk that stale or indirect signals, (like outdated WHOIS data, complex phone and email ecosystems, or inherited infrastructure) can be abused. These changes push the ecosystem toward standardized (e.g., <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555/">ACME</a>), modern, and auditable Domain Control Validation methods. They increase agility and resilience by encouraging site owners to transition to modern Domain Control Validation methods, creating opportunities for faster and more efficient certificate lifecycle management through <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/10/unlocking-power-of-tls-certificate.html">automation</a>.
</p>
<p>
These initiatives remove weak links in how trust is established on the internet. That leads to a safer browsing experience <strong>for everyone</strong>, not just users of a single browser, platform, or website.

### [FBI Warns of Fake Video Scams](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/fbi-warns-of-fake-video-scams.html) - December 10, 2025

<p>The FBI is <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA251205">warning</a> of  AI-assisted fake kidnapping scams:</p>
<blockquote><p>Criminal actors typically will contact their victims through text message claiming they have kidnapped their loved one and demand a ransom be paid for their release. Oftentimes, the criminal actor will express significant claims of violence towards the loved one if the ransom is not paid immediately. The criminal actor will then send what appears to be a genuine photo or video of the victim&#8217;s loved one, which upon close inspection often reveals inaccuracies when compared to confirmed photos of the loved one. Examples of these inaccuracies include missing tattoos or scars and inaccurate body proportions. Criminal actors will sometimes purposefully send these photos using timed message features to limit the amount of time victims have to analyze the images...</p></blockquote>
