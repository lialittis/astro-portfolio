### [Flock Exposes Its AI-Enabled Surveillance Cameras](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/flock-exposes-its-ai-enabled-surveillance-cameras.html) - January 02, 2026

<p>404 Media has the <a href="https://www.404media.co/flock-exposed-its-ai-powered-cameras-to-the-internet-we-tracked-ourselves/">story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike many of Flock&#8217;s cameras, which are designed to capture license plates as people drive by, Flock&#8217;s Condor cameras are pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras designed to record and track people, not vehicles. Condor cameras can be set to automatically zoom in on people&#8217;s faces as they walk through a parking lot, down a public street, or play on a playground, or they can be controlled manually, according to marketing material on Flock&#8217;s website. We watched Condor cameras zoom in on a woman walking her dog on a bike path in suburban Atlanta; a camera followed a man walking through a Macy&#8217;s parking lot in Bakersfield; surveil children swinging on a swingset at a playground; and film high-res video of people sitting at a stoplight in traffic. In one case, we were able to watch a man rollerblade down Brookhaven, Georgia&#8217;s Peachtree Creek Greenway bike path. The Flock camera zoomed in on him and tracked him as he rolled past. Minutes later, he showed up on another exposed camera livestream further down the bike path. The camera&#8217;s resolution was good enough that we were able to see that, when he stopped beneath one of the cameras, he was watching rollerblading videos on his phone...</p></blockquote>

Attack Surface Management (ASM) tools promise reduced risk. What they usually deliver is more information.&nbsp;
Security teams deploy ASM, asset inventories grow, alerts start flowing, and dashboards fill up. There is visible activity and measurable output. But when leadership asks a simple question, “Is this reducing incidents?” the answer is often unclear.&nbsp;
