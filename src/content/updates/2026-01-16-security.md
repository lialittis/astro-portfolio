Not long ago, AI agents were harmless. They wrote snippets of code. They answered questions. They helped individuals move a little faster.
Then organizations got ambitious.
Instead of personal copilots, companies started deploying shared organizational AI agents - agents embedded into HR, IT, engineering, customer support, and operations. Agents that don&rsquo;t just suggest, but act. Agents

### [Lack of isolation in agentic browsers resurfaces old vulnerabilities](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2026/01/13/lack-of-isolation-in-agentic-browsers-resurfaces-old-vulnerabilities/) - January 13, 2026

<p>With browser-embedded AI agents, we&rsquo;re essentially starting the security journey over again. We exploited a lack of isolation mechanisms in multiple agentic browsers to perform attacks ranging from the dissemination of false information to cross-site data leaks. These attacks, which are functionally similar to cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), resurface decades-old patterns of vulnerabilities that the web security community spent years building effective defenses against.</p>
<p>The root cause of these vulnerabilities is inadequate isolation. Many users implicitly trust browsers with their most sensitive data, using them to access bank accounts, healthcare portals, and social media. The rapid, bolt-on integration of AI agents into the browser environment gives them the same access to user data and credentials. Without proper isolation, these agents can be exploited to compromise any data or service the user&rsquo;s browser can reach.</p>
<p>In this post, we outline a generic threat model that identifies four trust zones and four violation classes. We demonstrate real-world exploits, including data exfiltration and session confusion, and we provide both immediate mitigations and long-term architectural solutions. (We do not name specific products as the affected vendors declined coordinated disclosure, and these architectural flaws affect agentic browsers broadly.)</p>
<p>For developers of agentic browsers, our key recommendation is to extend the Same-Origin Policy to AI agents, building on proven principles that successfully secured the web.</p>
<h2 id="threat-model-a-deadly-combination-of-tools"><strong>Threat model: A deadly combination of tools</strong></h2>
<p>To understand why agentic browsers are vulnerable, we need to identify the trust zones involved and what happens when data flows between them without adequate controls.</p>
<h3 id="the-trust-zones"><strong>The trust zones</strong></h3>
<p>In a typical agentic browser, we identify four primary trust zones:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Chat context:</strong> The agent&rsquo;s client-side components, including the agentic loop, conversation history, and local state (where the AI agent &ldquo;thinks&rdquo; and maintains context).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Third-party servers:</strong> The agent&rsquo;s server-side components, primarily the LLM itself when provided as an API by a third party. User data sent here leaves the user&rsquo;s control entirely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Browsing origins:</strong> Each website the user interacts with represents a separate trust zone containing independent private user data. Traditional browser security (the Same-Origin Policy) should keep these strictly isolated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>External network:</strong> The broader internet, including attacker-controlled websites, malicious documents, and other untrusted sources.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This simplified model captures the essential security boundaries present in most agentic browser implementations.</p>
<h3 id="trust-zone-violations"><strong>Trust zone violations</strong></h3>
<p>Typical agentic browser implementations make various tools available to the agent: fetching web pages, reading files, accessing history, making HTTP requests, and interacting with the Document Object Model (DOM). From a threat modeling perspective, each tool creates data transfers between trust zones. Due to inadequate controls or incorrect assumptions, this often results in unwanted or unexpected data paths.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve distilled these data paths into four classes of trust zone violations, which serve as primitives for constructing more sophisticated attacks:</p>
<p><strong>INJECTION:</strong> Adding arbitrary data to the chat context through an untrusted vector. It’s well known that LLMs cannot distinguish between data and instructions; this fundamental limitation is what enables prompt injection attacks. Any tool that adds arbitrary data to the chat history is a prompt injection vector; this includes tools that fetch webpages or attach untrusted files, such as PDFs. Data flows from the <strong>external network</strong> into the <strong>chat context</strong>, crossing the system&rsquo;s external security boundary.</p>
<p><strong>CTX_IN (context in):</strong> Adding sensitive data to the chat context from browsing origins. Examples include tools that retrieve personal data from online services or that include excerpts of the user&rsquo;s browsing history. When the AI model is owned by a third party, this data flows from <strong>browsing origins</strong> through the <strong>chat context</strong> and ultimately to <strong>third-party servers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>REV_CTX_IN (reverse context in):</strong> Updating browsing origins using data from the chat context. This includes tools that log a user in or update their browsing history. The data crosses the same security boundary as CTX_IN, but in the opposite direction: from the <strong>chat context</strong> back into <strong>browsing origins</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>CTX_OUT (context out):</strong> Using data from the chat context in external requests. Any tool that can make HTTP requests falls into this category, as side channels always exist. Even indirect requests pose risks, so tools that interact with webpages or manipulate the DOM should also be included. This represents data flowing from the <strong>chat context</strong> to the <strong>external network</strong>, where attackers can observe it.</p>
<h3 id="combining-violations-to-create-exploits"><strong>Combining violations to create exploits</strong></h3>
<p>Individual trust zone violations are concerning, but the real danger emerges when they&rsquo;re combined. INJECTION alone can implant false information in the chat history without the user noticing, potentially influencing decisions. The combination of INJECTION and CTX_OUT leaks data from the chat history to attacker-controlled servers. While chat data is not necessarily sensitive, adding CTX_IN, including tools that retrieve sensitive user data, enables complete data exfiltration.</p>
<p>One additional risk worth noting is that many agentic browsers run on Chromium builds that are weeks or months behind on security patches. This means prompt injection attacks can be chained with browser exploitation vulnerabilities, escalating from AI manipulation to full browser compromise. While we focused our research on the AI-specific attack surface, this lag in browser security updates compounds the risk.</p>
<p>These aren&rsquo;t theoretical concerns. In the following sections, we&rsquo;ll show exactly how we combined these trust zone violations to compromise real agentic browsers.</p>
<h2 id="demonstrating-real-world-attacks"><strong>Demonstrating real-world attacks</strong></h2>
<p>We conducted security assessments of multiple agentic browsers, and discovered numerous exploitable vulnerabilities in the process. The attacks below, organized by their primary impact, demonstrate how trust zone violations combine to create a range of real-world exploits.</p>
<h3 id="manipulation-attacks-controlling-what-the-agent-believes-and-says"><strong>Manipulation attacks: Controlling what the agent believes and says</strong></h3>
<p>These attacks exploit the agent&rsquo;s inability to distinguish between trusted instructions and attacker-controlled data to manipulate its behavior and output.</p>
<h4 id="false-information-reflected-xss-for-ai"><strong>False information:</strong> Reflected XSS for AI</h4>
<p><strong>Trust zone violations:</strong> INJECTION</p>
<p>Using two different vectors, a GitHub gist and a PDF document, we had the agent claim Yuri Gagarin was the first man on the moon or recommend a fictitious company that divides AI training cost by 100 times.</p>

<p>This bears striking similarity to traditional reflected XSS attacks, where an attacker exploits a data validation flaw that blurs the boundary between data and instructions through the lack of HTML tag and control structure escaping. An XSS payload, typically embedded in a malicious link, triggers the execution of a script that may alter the normal content of the page. This is functionally identical to what happens with this prompt injection.</p>
<h4 id="session-confusion-through-magic-links"><strong>Session confusion through magic links</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Trust zone violations:</strong> INJECTION, REV_CTX_IN</p>
<p>We prepared a malicious website that embedded a prompt injection and an email-based magic link authentication URL. When the user asks the agent to summarize the page, it opens the URL, silently logging the user into an attacker-controlled account. Users might inadvertently reveal sensitive information, believing they&rsquo;re interacting with their own account.</p>

<p>Once again, this bears similarity to reflected XSS attacks. In this case, the equivalent XSS script would leak data from its execution context, such as credentials, using AJAX.</p>
<p>We found that alignment was not a real obstacle in practice and that guardrails can usually be circumvented because exploits don&rsquo;t require unrestricted HTTP tools. For instance, we created a side channel by querying invalid whitelisted domains (e.g., <code>leaked-data.wikipedia.org</code>) for DNS-based exfiltration (when DNS traffic is unencrypted). Alternatively, we exfiltrated data through Google Search by combining the leaked data with low-probability search terms that can be easily monitored on Google Search Console.</p>

<p>We enhanced the previous exploit by instructing the model to retrieve sensitive data from services where the user was logged in. This works because current agentic browsers automatically reuse cookies for agent-initiated requests. Since the malicious instructions originate from a separate, attacker-controlled location (such as a website or attachment), this is functionally identical to a CSRF attack.</p>

<p>We stole sensitive information from a user&rsquo;s Instagram account by sending a malicious direct message. When the user requested a summary of their Instagram page or the last message they received, the agent followed the injected instructions to retrieve contact names or message snippets. This data was exfiltrated through a request to an attacker-controlled location, through side channels, or by using the Instagram chat itself if a tool to interact with the page was available. Note that this type of attack can affect any website that displays content from other users, including popular platforms such as X, Slack, LinkedIn, Reddit, Hacker News, GitHub, Pastebin, and even Wikipedia.</p>

<h2 id="securing-agentic-browsers-a-path-forward"><strong>Securing agentic browsers: A path forward</strong></h2>
<p>The security challenges posed by agentic browsers are real, but they&rsquo;re not insurmountable. Based on our audit work, we&rsquo;ve developed a set of recommendations that significantly improve the security posture of agentic browsers. We&rsquo;ve organized these into short-term mitigations that can be implemented quickly, and longer-term architectural solutions that require more research but offer more flexible security.</p>
<h3 id="short-term-mitigations"><strong>Short-term mitigations</strong></h3>
<h4 id="isolate-tool-browsing-contexts"><strong>Isolate tool browsing contexts</strong></h4>
<p>Tools should not authenticate as the user or access the user data. Instead, tools should be isolated entirely, such as by running in a separate browser instance or a minimal, sandboxed browser engine. This isolation prevents tools from reusing and setting cookies, reading or writing history, and accessing local storage.</p>
<p>This approach is efficient in addressing multiple trust zone violation classes, as it prevents sensitive data from being added to the chat history (CTX_IN), stops the agent from authenticating as the user, and blocks malicious modifications to user context (REV_CTX_IN). However, it&rsquo;s also restrictive; it prevents the agent from interacting with services the user is already authenticated to, reducing much of the convenience that makes agentic browsers attractive. Some flexibility can be restored by asking users to reauthenticate in the tool&rsquo;s context when privileged access is needed, though this adds friction to the user experience.</p>
<h4 id="split-tools-into-task-based-components"><strong>Split tools into task-based components</strong></h4>
<p>Rather than providing broad, powerful tools that access multiple services, split them into smaller, task-based components. For instance, have one tool per service or API (such as a dedicated Gmail tool). This increases parametrization and limits the attack surface.</p>
<p>Like context isolation, this is effective but restrictive. It potentially requires dozens of service-specific tools, limiting agent flexibility with new or uncommon services.</p>
<h4 id="provide-content-review-mechanisms"><strong>Provide content review mechanisms</strong></h4>
<p>Display previews of attachments and tool output directly in chat, with warnings prompting review. Clicking previews displays the exact textual content passed to the LLM, preventing differential issues such as invisible HTML elements.</p>
<p>This is a conceptually helpful mitigation but cumbersome in practice. Users are unlikely to review long documents thoroughly and may accept them blindly, leading to &ldquo;security theater.&rdquo; That said, it’s an effective defense layer for shorter content or when combined with smart heuristics that flag suspicious patterns.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-architectural-solutions"><strong>Long-term architectural solutions</strong></h3>
<p>These recommendations require further research and careful design, but offer flexible and efficient security boundaries without sacrificing power and convenience.</p>
<h4 id="implement-an-extended-same-origin-policy-for-ai-agents"><strong>Implement an extended same-origin policy for AI agents</strong></h4>
<p>For decades, the web&rsquo;s Same-Origin Policy (SOP) has been one of the most important security boundaries in browser design. Developed to prevent JavaScript-based XSS and CSRF attacks, the SOP governs how data from one origin should be accessed from another, creating a fundamental security boundary.</p>
<p>Our work reveals that agentic browser vulnerabilities bear striking similarities to XSS and CSRF vulnerabilities. Just as XSS blurs the boundary between data and code in HTML and JavaScript, prompt injections exploit the LLM&rsquo;s inability to distinguish between data and instructions. Similarly, just as CSRF abuses authenticated sessions to perform unauthorized actions, our cross-site data leak example abuses the agent&rsquo;s automatic cookie reuse.</p>
<p>Given this similarity, it makes sense to extend the SOP to AI agents rather than create new solutions from scratch. In particular, we can build on these proven principles to cover all data paths created by browser agent integration. Such an extension could work as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All attachments and pages loaded by tools are added to a list of origins for the chat session, in accordance with established origin definitions. Files are considered to be from different origins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the chat context has no origin listed, request-making tools may be used freely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the chat context has a single origin listed, requests can be made to that origin exclusively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the chat context has multiple origins listed, no requests can be made, as it&rsquo;s impossible to determine which origin influenced the model output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This approach is flexible and efficient when well-designed. It builds on decades of proven security principles from JavaScript and the web by leveraging the same conceptual framework that successfully hardened against XSS and CSRF. By extending established patterns rather than inventing new ones, we can create security boundaries that developers already understand and have demonstrated to be effective. This directly addresses CTX_OUT violations by preventing data of mixed origins from being exfiltrated, while still allowing valid use cases with a single origin.</p>
<p>Web search presents a particular challenge. Since it returns content from various sources and can be used in side channels, we recommend treating it as a multiple-origin tool only usable when the chat context has no origin.</p>
<h4 id="adopt-holistic-ai-security-frameworks"><strong>Adopt holistic AI security frameworks</strong></h4>
<p>To ensure comprehensive risk coverage, adopt established LLM security frameworks such as <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Guardrails">NVIDIA&rsquo;s NeMo Guardrails</a>. These frameworks offer systematic approaches to addressing common AI security challenges, including avoiding persistent changes without user confirmation, isolating authentication information from the LLM, parameterizing inputs and filtering outputs, and logging interactions thoughtfully while respecting user privacy.</p>
<h4 id="decouple-content-processing-from-task-planning"><strong>Decouple content processing from task planning</strong></h4>
<p>Recent research has shown promise in fundamentally separating trusted instruction handling from untrusted data using various <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08837">design patterns</a>. One interesting pattern for the agentic browser case is the dual-LLM scheme. Researchers at Google DeepMind and ETH Zurich (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18813">Defeating Prompt Injections by Design</a>) have proposed <a href="https://github.com/google-research/camel-prompt-injection">CaMeL (Capabilities for Machine Learning)</a>, a framework that brings this pattern a step further.</p>
<p>CaMeL employs a dual-LLM architecture, where a privileged LLM plans tasks based solely on trusted user queries, while a quarantined LLM (with no tool access) processes potentially malicious content. Critically, CaMeL tracks data provenance through a capability system—metadata tags that follow data as it flows through the system, recording its sources and allowed recipients. Before any tool executes, CaMeL&rsquo;s custom interpreter checks whether the operation violates security policies based on these capabilities.</p>
<p>For instance, if an attacker injects instructions to exfiltrate a confidential document, CaMeL blocks the email tool from executing because the document&rsquo;s capabilities indicate it shouldn&rsquo;t be shared with the injected recipient. The system enforces this through explicit security policies written in Python, making them as expressive as the programming language itself.</p>
<p>While still in its research phase, approaches like CaMeL demonstrate that with careful architectural design (in this case, explicitly separating control flow from data flow and enforcing fine-grained security policies), we can create AI agents with formal security guarantees rather than relying solely on guardrails or model alignment. This represents a fundamental shift from hoping models learn to be secure, to engineering systems that are secure by design. As these techniques mature, they offer the potential for flexible, efficient security that doesn&rsquo;t compromise on functionality.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-learned"><strong>What we learned</strong></h2>
<p>Many of the vulnerabilities we thought we&rsquo;d left behind in the early days of web security are resurfacing in new forms: prompt injection attacks against agentic browsers mirror XSS, and unauthorized data access repeats the harms of CSRF. In both cases, the fundamental problem is that LLMs cannot reliably distinguish between data and instructions. This limitation, combined with powerful tools that cross trust boundaries without adequate isolation, creates ideal conditions for exploitation. We&rsquo;ve demonstrated attacks ranging from subtle misinformation campaigns to complete data exfiltration and account compromise, all of which are achievable through relatively straightforward prompt injection techniques.</p>
<p><strong>The key insight from our work is that effective security mitigations must be grounded in system-level understanding.</strong> Individual vulnerabilities are symptoms; the real issue is inadequate controls between trust zones. Our threat model identifies four trust zones and four violation classes (INJECTION, CTX_IN, REV_CTX_IN, CTX_OUT), enabling developers to design architectural solutions that address root causes and entire vulnerability classes rather than specific exploits. The extended SOP concept and approaches like CaMeL’s capability system work because they’re grounded in understanding how data flows between origins and trust zones, which is the same principled thinking that led to the Same-Origin Policy: understanding the system-level problem, rather than just fixing individual bugs.</p>
<p>Successful defenses will require mapping trust zones, identifying where data crosses boundaries, and building isolation mechanisms tailored to the unique challenges of AI agents. The web security community learned these lessons with XSS and CSRF. Applying that same disciplined approach to the challenge of agentic browsers is a necessary path forward.</p>
