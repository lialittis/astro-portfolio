### [AI and the Corporate Capture of Knowledge](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/ai-and-the-corporate-capture-of-knowledge.html) - January 16, 2026

<p>More than a decade after <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/Open-access-tributes-to-Aaron-Swartz-4193965.php">Aaron Swartz&#8217;s death</a>, the United States is still living inside the contradiction that destroyed him.</p>
<p>Swartz believed that knowledge, especially publicly funded knowledge, should be freely accessible. Acting on that, he downloaded thousands of academic articles from the <a href="https://www.jstor.org/">JSTOR</a> archive with the intention of making them publicly available. For this, the federal government charged him with a felony and threatened decades in prison. After two years of prosecutorial pressure, Swartz died by suicide on Jan. 11, 2013.</p>
<p>The still-unresolved questions raised by his case have resurfaced in today&#8217;s debates over artificial intelligence, copyright and the ultimate control of knowledge...</p>
