<p>No matter how many times we say it, the idea comes back again and again. Hopefully, this <a href="https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/">letter</a> will hold back the tide for at least a while longer.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Executive summary:</b> Scientists have understood for many years that internet voting is insecure and that there is no known or foreseeable technology that can make it secure.  Still, vendors of internet voting keep claiming that, somehow, their new system is different, or the insecurity doesn&#8217;t matter.  Bradley Tusk and his Mobile Voting Foundation keep touting internet voting to journalists and election administrators; this whole effort is misleading and dangerous...</p></blockquote>

Every managed security provider is chasing the same problem in 2026 — too many alerts, too few analysts, and clients demanding “CISO-level protection” at SMB budgets.
The truth? Most MSSPs are running harder, not smarter. And it’s breaking their margins. That’s where the quiet revolution is happening: AI isn’t just writing reports or surfacing risks — it’s rebuilding how security services are
