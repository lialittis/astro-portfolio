### [New Android Theft Protection Feature Updates: Smarter, Stronger](http://security.googleblog.com/2026/01/android-theft-protection-feature-updates.html) - January 27, 2026

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Nataliya Stanetsky, Fabricio Ferracioli, Elliot Sisteron, Irene Ang of the Android Security Team</span>

<p>
Phone theft is more than just losing a device; it's a form of financial fraud that can leave you suddenly vulnerable to personal data and financial theft. That’s why we're committed to providing multi-layered defenses that help protect you before, during, and after a theft attempt.
</p>
<p>
Today, we're announcing a powerful set of theft protection feature updates that build on our<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/10/android-theft-protection.html"> existing protections</a>, designed to give you greater peace of mind by making your device a much harder target for criminals.
</p>
<h3>Stronger Authentication Safeguards</h3>


<p>
We've expanded our security to protect you against an even wider range of threats. These updates are now available for Android devices running Android 16+.
</p>
<p>
<strong>More User Control for Failed Authentications: </strong>In Android 15, <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-theft-protection/">we launched</a> Failed Authentication Lock, a feature that automatically locks the device's screen after excessive failed authentication attempts. This feature is now getting a new dedicated enable/disable toggle in settings, giving you more granular control over your device's security.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Expanding Identity Check to cover more: </strong><a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/01/android-theft-protection-identity-check-expanded-features.html">Early in 2025</a>, we enabled Identity Check for Android 15+, which requires the user to utilize biometrics when performing certain actions outside of trusted places. Later in the year, we extended this safeguard to cover all features and apps that use the Android Biometric Prompt. This means that critical tools that utilize Biometric Prompt, like third-party banking apps and Google Password Manager, now automatically benefit from the additional security of Identity Check.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Stronger Protection Against Screen Lock Guessing: </strong>We’re making it much harder for a thief to guess your PIN, pattern, or password by increasing the lockout time after failed attempts. To ensure you aren’t locked out by mistake (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-my-son-secured-android-lockscreen-jeremiah-cox-vn88c/">by a curious child</a>, for instance), identical incorrect guesses no longer count toward your retry limit. 
</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVh6O_BTgr0Y5vICILPIdLfewGVuyy6CbPwm-MswORJJOuvoZnXnFD4A4-3uo0iUa0bKWCxVs5E5RQy1kvWFSI6cmYYcbUqHlucIEqLkszJ-kxrcWhqn_HXVuRPglXmtUe1gPRwHaYZ-K9GBQWCPW0izyvLIMr5Rus8e9BZUPFXJTG5LjivTdUFIEiQdtB/s3816/Android%20Theft%20Protection_Image.png" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center;"><img alt="" border="0" height="600" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiVh6O_BTgr0Y5vICILPIdLfewGVuyy6CbPwm-MswORJJOuvoZnXnFD4A4-3uo0iUa0bKWCxVs5E5RQy1kvWFSI6cmYYcbUqHlucIEqLkszJ-kxrcWhqn_HXVuRPglXmtUe1gPRwHaYZ-K9GBQWCPW0izyvLIMr5Rus8e9BZUPFXJTG5LjivTdUFIEiQdtB/s600/Android%20Theft%20Protection_Image.png" /></a></div>
  </a>
</div>

<h3>Enhanced Recovery Tools</h3>


<p>
We're also enhancing our recovery tools to make them even more helpful. This update is now available for Android devices running Android 10+.
</p>
<p>
<strong>More Control for Remote Lock. </strong>Remote Lock (<a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/android.com/lock">android.com/lock</a>) is a crucial tool that lets you lock your lost or stolen device from any web browser. We are adding a new optional security question/challenge to the process. This helps ensure that only you, the real device owner, can initiate a lock, adding another layer of security to your recovery flow.<br />
</p>
<h3>Proactive Protection: "Default-On" in Brazil</h3>


<p>
Keeping our users safe is a top priority, which is why we're working to make theft protection available out-of-the-box for more Android users. For new Android devices activated in Brazil, two of our key <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/15146908?hl=en">theft protection features</a> are now enabled by default:
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Theft Detection Lock:</strong> Uses on-device AI to sense motion and context that may indicate a "snatch-and-run" theft. If a theft attempt is detected, it will quickly lock the device screen to help protect your data.</li>

<li><strong>Remote Lock:</strong> Allows users to lock their device from any device that provides a web access to <a href="http://android.com/lock">android.com/lock</a> without the need to have enabled the feature in advance.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This helps ensure new devices have a critical layer of theft protection from day one.
</p>
<h3>Continuing To innovate in Device Theft Protection</h3>


<p>
We’re always evolving our protections to stay one step ahead of thieves. Our ongoing updates help ensure that no matter where you go, you can have greater peace of mind knowing your device and data are protected by Android’s multi-layered defenses. Keep a lookout for even more Android theft protection updates.

<p>The US Supreme Court is <a href="https://therecord.media/supreme-court-geofence-constitutionality">considering</a> the constitutionality of geofence warrants.</p>
<blockquote><p>The case centers on the trial of Okello Chatrie, a Virginia man who pleaded guilty to a 2019 robbery outside of Richmond and was sentenced to almost 12 years in prison for stealing $195,000 at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Police probing the crime found security camera footage showing a man on a cell phone near the credit union that was robbed and asked Google to produce anonymized location data near the robbery site so they could determine who committed the crime. They did so, providing police with subscriber data for three people, one of whom was Chatrie. Police then searched Chatrie&#8217;s home and allegedly surfaced a gun, almost $100,000 in cash and incriminating notes...</p></blockquote>

Cybersecurity teams increasingly want to move beyond looking at threats and vulnerabilities in isolation. It’s not only about what could go wrong (vulnerabilities) or who might attack (threats), but where they intersect in your actual environment to create real, exploitable exposure.
Which exposures truly matter? Can attackers exploit them? Are our defenses effective?
