### [Friday Squid Blogging: New Squid Species Discovered](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/friday-squid-blogging-new-squid-species-discovered.html) - January 30, 2026

<p>A <a href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/mollusks/very-novel-and-very-puzzling-unknown-species-of-squid-spotted-burying-itself-upside-down-pretending-to-be-a-plant">new species of squid</a>. pretends to be a plant:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scientists have filmed a never-before-seen species of deep-sea squid burying itself upside down in the seafloor&#8212;a behavior never documented in cephalopods. They captured the bizarre scene while studying the depths of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ), an abyssal plain in the Pacific Ocean targeted for deep-sea mining.</p>
<p>The team described the encounter in a study published Nov. 25 in the journal <a href="https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecy.70257"><i>Ecology</i></a>, writing that the animal appears to be an undescribed species of whiplash squid. At a depth of roughly 13,450 feet (4,100 meters), the squid had buried almost its entire body in sediment and was hanging upside down, with its siphon and two long ...</p></blockquote>

### [AIs Are Getting Better at Finding and Exploiting Security Vulnerabilities](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/ais-are-getting-better-at-finding-and-exploiting-security-vulnerabilities.html) - January 30, 2026

<p>From an Anthropic <a href="https://red.anthropic.com/2026/cyber-toolkits-update/">blog post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In a recent evaluation of AI models’ cyber capabilities, current Claude models can now succeed at multistage attacks on networks with dozens of hosts using only standard, open-source tools, instead of the custom tools needed by previous generations. This illustrates how barriers to the use of AI in relatively autonomous cyber workflows are rapidly coming down, and highlights the importance of security fundamentals like promptly patching known vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>A notable development during the testing of Claude Sonnet 4.5 is that the model can now succeed on a minority of the networks without the custom cyber toolkit needed by previous generations. In particular, Sonnet 4.5 can now exfiltrate all of the (simulated) personal information in a high-fidelity simulation of the Equifax data breach&#8212;one of the costliest cyber attacks in history­­using only a Bash shell on a widely-available Kali Linux host (standard, open-source tools for penetration testing; not a custom toolkit). Sonnet 4.5 accomplishes this by instantly recognizing a publicized CVE and writing code to exploit it without needing to look it up or iterate on it. Recalling that the original Equifax breach happened by exploiting a publicized CVE that had not yet been patched, the prospect of highly competent and fast AI agents leveraging this approach underscores the pressing need for security best practices like prompt updates and patches...</p></blockquote>

### [Celebrating our 2025 open-source contributions](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2026/01/30/celebrating-our-2025-open-source-contributions/) - January 30, 2026

<p>Last year, our engineers submitted over <strong>375 pull requests</strong> that were merged into non–Trail of Bits repositories, touching more than <strong>90 projects</strong> from cryptography libraries to the Rust compiler.</p>
<p>This work reflects one of our driving values: &ldquo;share what others can use.&rdquo; The measure isn&rsquo;t whether you share something, but whether it&rsquo;s actually useful to someone else. This principle is why we publish <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications?tab=readme-ov-file#guides-and-handbooks">handbooks</a>, write blog posts, and release tools like <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/skills">Claude skills</a>, <a href="https://github.com/crytic/slither">Slither</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/buttercup">Buttercup</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/anamorpher">Anamorpher</a>.</p>
<p>But this value isn’t limited to our own projects; we also share our efforts with the wider open-source community. When we hit limitations in tools we depend on, we fix them upstream. When we find ways to make the software ecosystem more secure, we contribute those improvements.</p>
<p>Most of these contributions came out of client work—we hit a bug we were able to fix or wanted a feature that didn&rsquo;t exist. The lazy option would have been forking these projects for our needs or patching them locally. Contributing upstream instead takes longer, but it means the next person doesn&rsquo;t have to solve the same problem. Some of our work is also funded directly by organizations like the OpenSSF and Alpha-Omega, who we collaborate with to make things better for everyone.</p>
<h2 id="key-contributions">Key contributions</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor"><strong>Sigstore rekor-monitor</strong></a>: rekor-monitor verifies and monitors the Rekor transparency log, which records signing events for software artifacts. With funding from OpenSSF, we&rsquo;ve been <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/12/12/catching-malicious-package-releases-using-a-transparency-log/">getting rekor-monitor ready for production use</a>. We contributed over 40 pull requests to the Rekor project this year, including <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor/pull/764">support for custom certificate authorities</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor/pull/705">support for the new Rekor v2</a>. We also <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-monitor/pull/751">added identity monitoring</a> for <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor-tiles">Rekor v2</a>, which lets package maintainers configure monitored certificate subjects and issuers and then receive alerts whenever matching entries appear in the log. If someone compromises your release process and signs a malicious package with your identity, you&rsquo;ll know.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust"><strong>Rust compiler</strong></a> <strong>and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">rust-clippy</a></strong>: Clippy is Rust&rsquo;s official linting tool, offering over 750 lints to catch common mistakes. We contributed over 20 merged pull requests this year. For example, we <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/14177">extended the <code>implicit_clone</code> lint to handle <code>to_string()</code> calls</a>, which let us deprecate the redundant <code>string_to_string</code> lint. We <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/13669">added replacement suggestions to <code>disallowed_methods</code></a> so that teams can suggest alternatives when flagging forbidden API usage, and we <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/pull/14397">added path validation for <code>disallowed_*</code> configurations</a> so that typos don&rsquo;t silently disable lint rules. We also <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/139345">extended the <code>QueryStability</code> lint to handle <code>IntoIterator</code> implementations</a> in rustc, which catches nondeterminism bugs in the compiler. The motivation came from a real issue we spotted: iteration order over hash maps was leaking into rustdoc&rsquo;s JSON output.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography"><strong>pyca/cryptography</strong></a>: pyca/cryptography is Python&rsquo;s most widely used cryptography library, providing both high-level recipes and low-level interfaces to common algorithms. With funding from Alpha-Omega, we landed 28 pull requests this year. Our work was aimed at adding <a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/pull/13325">a new ASN.1 API</a>, which lets developers define ASN.1 structures using Python decorators and type annotations instead of wrestling with raw bytes or external schema files. Read more in our blog post &ldquo;<a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/04/18/sneak-peek-a-new-asn.1-api-for-python/">Sneak peek: A new ASN.1 API for Python</a>.&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ethereum/hevm"><strong>hevm</strong></a>: hevm is a Haskell implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It powers both the symbolic and concrete execution in Echidna, our smart contract fuzzer. We contributed 14 pull requests this year, mostly focused on performance: we <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/hevm/pull/803">added cost centers to individual opcodes to ease profiling, optimized memory operations, and made stack and program counter operations strict</a>, which got us double-digit percentage improvements on concrete execution benchmarks. We also implemented cheatcodes like <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/hevm/pull/838"><code>toString</code></a> to improve hevm’s compatibility with Foundry.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pypi/warehouse"><strong>PyPI Warehouse</strong></a>: Warehouse powers the Python Package Index (PyPI), which serves over a billion package downloads per day. We continued our long-running collaboration with PyPI and Alpha-Omega, shipping <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/01/30/pypi-now-supports-archiving-projects/">project archival support</a> so that maintainers can signal when packages are no longer actively maintained. We also <a href="https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/05/01/making-pypis-test-suite-81-faster/">cut the test suite runtime by 81%</a>, from 163 to 30 seconds, even as test coverage grew to over 4,700 tests.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg"><strong>pwndbg</strong></a>: pwndbg is a GDB and LLDB plugin that makes debugging and exploit development less painful. Last year, we <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/pull/3195">packaged LLDB support for distributions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/pull/3548">improved decompiler integration</a>. We also contributed pull requests to other tools in the space, including pwntools, angr, and Binary Ninja&rsquo;s API.</li>
</ul>
<p>A merged pull request is the easy part. The hard part is everything maintainers do before and after: writing extensive documentation, keeping CI green, fielding bug reports, explaining the same thing to the fifth person who asks. We get to submit a fix and move on. They&rsquo;re still there a year later, making sure it all holds together.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who shaped these contributions with us, from first draft to merge. See you next year.</p>

### [Building cryptographic agility into Sigstore](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2026/01/29/building-cryptographic-agility-into-sigstore/) - January 29, 2026

<p>Software signatures carry an invisible expiration date. The container image or firmware you sign today might be deployed for 20 years, but the cryptographic signature protecting it may become untrustworthy within 10 years. SHA-1 certificates become worthless, weak RSA keys are banned, and quantum computers may crack today&rsquo;s elliptic curve cryptography. The question isn&rsquo;t whether our current signatures will fail, but whether we&rsquo;re prepared for when they do.</p>
<p>Sigstore, an open-source ecosystem for software signing, recognized this challenge early but initially chose security over flexibility by adopting new cryptographic algorithms as older ones became obsolete. By hard coding ECDSA with P-256 curves and SHA-256 throughout its infrastructure, Sigstore avoided the dangerous pitfalls that have plagued other crypto-agile systems. This conservative approach worked well during early adoption, but as Sigstore&rsquo;s usage grew, the rigidity that once protected it began to restrict its utility.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, Trail of Bits has collaborated with the Sigstore community to systematically address the limitations of aging cryptographic signatures. Our work established a centralized algorithm registry in the Protobuf specifications to serve as a single source of truth. Second, we updated Rekor and Fulcio to accept configurable algorithm restrictions. And finally, we integrated these capabilities into Cosign, allowing users to select their preferred signing algorithm when generating ephemeral keys. We also developed Go implementations of post-quantum algorithms LMS and ML-DSA, demonstrating that the new architecture can accommodate future cryptographic standards. Here is what motivated these changes, what security considerations shaped our approach, and how to use the new functionality.</p>
<h2 id="sigstores-cryptographic-constraints">Sigstore&rsquo;s cryptographic constraints</h2>
<p>Sigstore hard codes ECDSA with P-256 curves and SHA-256 throughout most of its ecosystem. This rigidity is a deliberate design choice. From Fulcio certificate issuance to Rekor transparency logs to Cosign workflows, most steps default to this same algorithm. Cryptographic agility has historically led to serious security vulnerabilities, and focusing on a limited set of algorithms reduces the chance of something going wrong.</p>
<p>This conservative approach, however, has created challenges as the ecosystem has matured. Various organizations and users have vastly different requirements that Sigstore&rsquo;s rigid approach cannot accommodate. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Compliance-driven organizations</strong> might need NIST-standard algorithms to meet regulatory requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Open-source maintainers</strong> may want to sign artifacts without making cryptographic decisions, relying on secure defaults from the public Sigstore instance.</li>
<li><strong>Security-conscious enterprises</strong> may want to deploy internal Sigstore instances using only post-quantum cryptography.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, software artifacts remain in use for decades, meaning today&rsquo;s signatures must stay verifiable far into the future, and the cryptographic algorithm used today might not be secure 10 years from now.</p>
<p>These challenges can be addressed only if Sigstore allows for a certain degree of cryptographic agility. The goal is to enable controlled cryptographic flexibility without repeating the security issues that have affected other crypto-agile systems. To address this, the Sigstore community has developed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vTKFvTQdRt3OGz6Qd1xf04o-hugRYSup-1EAOWn7MQ/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.op2lvfrgiugr">design document</a> outlining how to introduce cryptographic agility while maintaining strong security guarantees.</p>
<h2 id="the-dangers-of-cryptographic-flexibility">The dangers of cryptographic flexibility</h2>
<p>The most infamous example of problems caused by cryptographic flexibility is <a href="https://jwt.io/introduction">the JWT</a> <code>alg:</code> <code>none</code> vulnerability, where some JWT libraries treated tokens signed with the <code>none</code> algorithm as valid tokens, allowing anyone to forge arbitrary tokens and “sign” whatever payload they wanted. Even more subtle is the <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/jwt/algorithm-confusion">RSA/HMAC confusion attack in JWT</a>, where a mismatch between what kind of algorithm a server expects and what it receives allows anyone with knowledge of the RSA public key to forge tokens that pass verification.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem in both cases is in-band algorithm signaling, which allows the data to specify how it should be protected. This creates an opportunity for attackers to manipulate the algorithm choice to their advantage. As the cryptographic community has learned through painful experience, cryptographic agility introduces significant complexity, leading to more code and increased potential attack vectors.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution-controlled-cryptographic-flexibility">The solution: Controlled cryptographic flexibility</h2>
<p>Instead of allowing users to mix and match any algorithms they want, Sigstore introduced predefined algorithm suites, which are complete packages that specify exactly which cryptographic components work together.</p>
<p>For example, <code>PKIX_ECDSA_P256_SHA_256</code> not only includes the signing algorithm (ECDSA P-256), but also mandates SHA-256 for hashing. A <code>PKIX_ECDSA_P384_SHA_384</code> suite pairs ECDSA P-384 with SHA-384, and <code>PKIX_ED25519</code> uses Ed25519 and SHA-512. Users can choose between these suites, but they can&rsquo;t create dangerous combinations, such as ECDSA P-384 with MD5.</p>
<p>Critically, the choice of which algorithm to use comes from out-of-band negotiation, meaning it&rsquo;s determined by configuration or policy, not by the data being signed. This prevents the in-band signaling attacks that have plagued other systems.</p>
<h2 id="the-implementation">The implementation</h2>
<p>To enable cryptographic agility across the Sigstore ecosystem, we needed to make coordinated changes that would work together seamlessly. Cryptography is used in several places within the Sigstore ecosystem; however, we primarily focused on enabling clients to change the signing algorithm used to sign and verify artifacts, as this would have a significant impact on end users. We tackled this change in three phases.</p>

<p>We introduced a centralized <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/protobuf-specs/blob/966b43d006e7fc938b30724933af34c8e351f2a1/protos/sigstore_common.proto#L46-L129">algorithm registry</a> in the Protobuf specifications that defines all <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore/blob/1e63a2159e71d968a5fa46215280103844797ee8/pkg/signature/algorithm_registry.go#L154">allowed algorithms</a> and their details. We also implemented <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore/blob/1e63a2159e71d968a5fa46215280103844797ee8/pkg/signature/algorithm_registry.go#L238-L298">default mappings</a> from key types to signing algorithms (e.g., ECDSA P-256 keys automatically use ECDSA P-256 + SHA-256), eliminating ambiguity and providing a single source of truth for all Sigstore components.</p>
<h3 id="phase-2-service-level-updates">Phase 2: Service-level updates</h3>
<p>We updated <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/pull/1974">Rekor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/pull/1938">Fulcio</a> with a new <code>--client-signing-algorithms</code> flag that lets deployments specify which algorithms they accept, enabling custom restrictions like Ed25519-only or future post-quantum-only deployments. We also <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/fulcio/pull/1959">fixed Fulcio</a> to use proper hash algorithms for each key type (SHA-384 for ECDSA P-384, etc.) instead of defaulting everything to SHA-256.</p>
<h3 id="phase-3-client-integration">Phase 3: Client integration</h3>
<p>We updated Cosign to support multiple algorithms by <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/4050">removing hard-coded SHA-256</a> usage and adding a <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/pull/3497"><code>--signing-algorithm</code></a> flag for generating different ephemeral key types. Currently available in <code>cosign sign-blob</code> and <code>cosign verify-blob</code>, these changes let users bring their own keys of any supported type and easily select their preferred cryptographic algorithm when ephemeral keys are used. Other clients implementing the Sigstore specification can choose which set of algorithms to use, as long as it is a subset of the allowed algorithms listed in the algorithm registry.</p>
<h3 id="validation-proving-it-works">Validation: Proving it works</h3>
<p>To demonstrate the flexibility of our new architecture, we developed HashEdDSA (Ed25519ph) support in both <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/pull/1945">Rekor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore/pull/1595">the Sigstore Go library</a> and created Go implementations of post-quantum algorithms <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/lms-go">LMS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/ml-dsa">ML-DSA</a>. This work proved that our modular architecture can accommodate diverse cryptographic algorithms and provides a solid foundation for future additions, including post-quantum cryptography.</p>
<h2 id="cryptographic-flexibility-in-action">Cryptographic flexibility in action</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see this cryptographic flexibility in action by setting up a custom Sigstore deployment. We&rsquo;ll configure a private Rekor instance that accepts only ECDSA P-521 with SHA-512 and RSA-4096 with SHA-256, by using the <code>--client-signing-algorithms</code> flag, demonstrating both algorithm restriction and the new Cosign capabilities.</p>

<p>This last command performs a few steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generates an ephemeral private/public ECDSA P-521 key pair and gets the SHA-512 hash of the artifact (<code>--signing-algorithm=ecdsa-sha2-512-nistp521</code>)</li>

<li>Saves everything into the <code>cosign.bundle</code> file (<code>--bundle cosign.bundle</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>We can verify the data in the bundle to ensure ECDSA P-521 was actually used (with the right hash function):</p>

<p>Now let’s try a different key type to see if it&rsquo;s rejected by Rekor. To generate a different key type, we just need to switch the value of <code>--signing-algorithm</code> in Cosign:</p>

</figure>
<p>As we can see, Rekor did not allow Cosign to save the entry (<code>entry algorithms are not allowed</code>), as <code>ecdsa-sha2-256-nistp256</code> was not part of the list of algorithms allowed through the <code>--client-signing-algorithms</code> flag used when starting the Rekor instance.</p>
<h2 id="future-proofing-sigstore">Future-proofing Sigstore</h2>
<p>The changes that Trail of Bits has implemented alongside the Sigstore community allow organizations to use different signing algorithms while maintaining the same security model that made Sigstore successful.</p>
<p>Sigstore now supports algorithm suites from ECDSA P-256 to Ed25519 to RSA variants, with a centralized registry ensuring consistency across deployments. Organizations can configure their instances to accept only specific algorithms, whether for compliance requirements or post-quantum preparation.</p>
<p>The foundation is now in place for future algorithm additions. As cryptographic standards evolve and new algorithms become available, Sigstore can adopt them through the same controlled process we&rsquo;ve established. Software signatures created today will remain verifiable as the ecosystem adapts to new cryptographic realities.</p>
