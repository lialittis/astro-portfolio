<p><a href="https://www.jmail.world/thread/EFTA02451032?view=inbox">Once</a>. Someone named &#8220;Vincenzo lozzo&#8221; wrote to Epstein in email, in 2016: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t pay too much attention to this, Schneier has a long tradition of dramatizing and misunderstanding things.&#8221; The topic of the email is DDoS attacks, and it is unclear what I am dramatizing and misunderstanding.</p>

### [iPhone Lockdown Mode Protects Washington Post Reporter](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/iphone-lockdown-mode-protects-washington-post-reporter.html) - February 06, 2026

<p>404Media is <a href="https://www.404media.co/fbi-couldnt-get-into-wapo-reporters-iphone-because-it-had-lockdown-mode-enabled/">reporting</a> that the FBI could not access a reporter&#8217;s iPhone because it had Lockdown Mode enabled:</p>
<blockquote><p>The court record shows what devices and data the FBI was able to ultimately access, and which devices it could not, after raiding the home of the reporter, Hannah Natanson, in January as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information. It also provides rare insight into the apparent effectiveness of Lockdown Mode, or at least how effective it might be before the FBI may try other techniques to access the device.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because the iPhone was in Lockdown mode, CART could not extract that device,&#8221; the court record reads, referring to the FBI&#8217;s Computer Analysis Response Team, a unit focused on performing forensic analyses of seized devices. The document is written by the government, and is opposing the return of Natanson&#8217;s devices...</p></blockquote>

### [Backdoor in Notepad++](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/backdoor-in-notepad.html) - February 05, 2026

<p>Hackers associated with the Chinese government used a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/notepad-updater-was-compromised-for-6-months-in-supply-chain-attack/">Trojaned version</a> of Notepad++ to deliver malware to selected users.</p>
<blockquote><p>Notepad++ said that officials with the unnamed provider hosting the update infrastructure consulted with incident responders and found that it remained compromised until September 2. Even then, the attackers maintained credentials to the internal services until December 2, a capability that allowed them to continue redirecting selected update traffic to malicious servers. The threat actor &#8220;specifically targeted Notepad++ domain with the goal of exploiting insufficient update verification controls that existed in older versions of Notepad++.&#8221; Event logs indicate that the hackers tried to re-exploit one of the weaknesses after it was fixed but that the attempt failed...</p></blockquote>

Today’s “AI everywhere” reality is woven into everyday workflows across the enterprise, embedded in SaaS platforms, browsers, copilots, extensions, and a rapidly expanding universe of shadow tools that appear faster than security teams can track. Yet most organizations still rely on legacy controls that operate far away from where AI interactions actually occur. The result is a widening
