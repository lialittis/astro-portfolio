Even more interesting is how it found them. Fuzzers work by throwing massive amounts of random inputs at code to see what breaks. Opus 4.6 reads and reasons about code the way a human researcher would­&#8212;looking at past fixes to find similar bugs that weren&#8217;t addressed, spotting patterns that tend to cause problems, or understanding a piece of logic well enough to know exactly what input would break it.
