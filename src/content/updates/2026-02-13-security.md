Threat activity this week shows one consistent signal — attackers are leaning harder on what already works. Instead of flashy new exploits, many operations are built around quiet misuse of trusted tools, familiar workflows, and overlooked exposures that sit in plain sight.
Another shift is how access is gained versus how it’s used. Initial entry points are getting simpler, while post-compromise

### [Prompt Injection Via Road Signs](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/prompt-injection-via-road-signs.html) - February 11, 2026

<p>Interesting research: &#8220;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00181">CHAI: Command Hijacking Against Embodied AI</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Embodied Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to handle edge cases in robotic vehicle systems where data is scarce by using common-sense reasoning grounded in perception and action to generalize beyond training distributions and adapt to novel real-world situations. These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness...</p></blockquote>

Intentionally vulnerable training applications are widely used for security education, internal testing, and product demonstrations. Tools such as OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA, Hackazon, and bWAPP are designed to be insecure by default, making them useful for learning how common attack techniques work in controlled environments.
The issue is not the applications themselves, but how they are often

Near as the editors could tell, many submitters pasted the magazine’s detailed story guidelines into an AI and sent in the results. And they weren’t alone. Other fiction magazines have also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/25/23613752/ai-generated-short-stories-literary-magazines-&#60;cite&#62;Clarkesworld&#60;/cite&#62;-science-fiction">reported a high number</a> of AI-generated submissions.</p>
<p>This is only one example of a ubiquitous trend. A legacy system relied on the difficulty of writing and cognition to limit volume. Generative AI overwhelms the system because the humans on the receiving end can’t keep up...</p>
