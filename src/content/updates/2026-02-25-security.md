### [Identity Prioritization isn't a Backlog Problem - It's a Risk Math Problem](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/identity-prioritization-isnt-backlog.html) - February 24, 2026

Most identity programs still prioritize work the way they prioritize IT tickets: by volume, loudness, or “what failed a control check.” That approach breaks the moment your environment stops being mostly-human and mostly-onboarded.
In modern enterprises, identity risk is created by a compound of factors: control posture, hygiene, business context, and intent. Any one of these can perhaps be

<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2026/02/password-managers-promise-that-they-cant-see-your-vaults-isnt-always-true/">Good article</a> on password managers that secretly have a backdoor.</p>
<blockquote><p>New research shows that these claims aren’t true in all cases, particularly when account recovery is in place or password managers are set to share vaults or organize users into groups. The researchers reverse-engineered or closely analyzed Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass and identified ways that someone with control over the server­&#8212;either administrative or the result of a compromise­&#8212;can, in fact, steal data and, in some cases, entire vaults. The researchers also devised other attacks that can weaken the encryption to the point that ciphertext can be converted to plaintext...</p></blockquote>

### [How Exposed Endpoints Increase Risk Across LLM Infrastructure](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/how-exposed-endpoints-increase-risk.html) - February 23, 2026

As more organizations run their own Large Language Models (LLMs), they are also deploying more internal services and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to support those models. Modern security risks are being introduced less from the models themselves and more from the infrastructure that serves, connects and automates the model. Each new LLM endpoint expands the attack surface, often in
