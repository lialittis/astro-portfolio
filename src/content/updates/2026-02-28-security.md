### [Cultivating a robust and efficient quantum-safe HTTPS](http://security.googleblog.com/2026/02/cultivating-robust-and-efficient.html) - February 27, 2026

<span class="byline-author">Posted by Chrome Secure Web and Networking Team</span>

<p>
Today we're announcing a new program in Chrome to make HTTPS certificates secure against quantum computers. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recently created a working group, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/plants/about/">PKI, Logs, And Tree Signatures</a> (“PLANTS”), aiming to address the performance and bandwidth challenges that the increased size of <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography">quantum-resistant cryptography</a> introduces into TLS connections requiring <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/howctworks/">Certificate Transparency</a> (CT). We recently <a href="https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/technology/safety-security/the-quantum-era-is-coming-are-we-ready-to-secure-it/">shared</a> our call to action to secure quantum computing and have written about challenges introduced by quantum-resistant cryptography and some of the steps we’ve taken to address them in earlier <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2023/08/protecting-chrome-traffic-with-hybrid.html">blog</a> <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2024/05/advancing-our-amazing-bet-on-asymmetric.html">posts</a>.
</p>
<p>
To ensure the scalability and efficiency of the ecosystem, Chrome has no immediate plan to add traditional X.509 certificates containing post-quantum cryptography to the <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/net/data/ssl/chrome_root_store/root_store.md">Chrome Root Store</a>. Instead, Chrome, in collaboration with other partners, is developing an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KQXAGBHXR4S_prwFrZlyfA6DrpvfJwuJ/view">evolution</a> of HTTPS certificates based on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-plants-merkle-tree-certs/">Merkle Tree Certificates</a> (MTCs), currently in development in the PLANTS working group. MTCs replace the heavy, serialized chain of signatures found in traditional PKI with compact <a href="https://research.swtch.com/tlog#merkle_trees">Merkle Tree proofs</a>. In this model, a Certification Authority (CA) signs a single "Tree Head" representing potentially millions of certificates, and the "certificate" sent to the browser is merely a lightweight proof of inclusion in that tree.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Why MTCs?</h3>


<p>
MTCs enable the adoption of robust post-quantum algorithms without incurring the massive bandwidth penalty of classical X.509 certificate chains. They also decouple the security strength of the corresponding cryptographic algorithm from the size of the data transmitted to the user. By shrinking the authentication data in a TLS handshake to the absolute minimum, MTCs aim to keep the post-quantum web as fast and seamless as today’s internet, maintaining high performance even as we adopt stronger security. Finally, with MTCs, transparency is a fundamental property of issuance: it is impossible to issue a certificate without including it in a public tree. This means the security properties of today’s CT ecosystem are included by default, and without adding extra overhead to the TLS handshake as CT does today.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Chrome’s MTC Propagation Plan</h3>


<p>
Chrome is already experimenting with MTCs with real internet traffic, and we intend to gradually build out our deployment such that MTCs provide a robust quantum-resistant HTTPS available for use throughout the internet.
</p>
<p>
Broadly speaking, our rollout spans three distinct phases.
</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Phase 1 (UNDERWAY):</strong> In <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.cloudflare.com/bootstrap-mtc/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1770666818817662&amp;usg=AOvVaw3YI8DKCxh8bqHxgrDZe04O">collaboration</a> with Cloudflare, we are conducting a feasibility study to evaluate the performance and security of TLS connections relying on MTCs. To ensure a seamless and secure experience for Chrome users who might encounter an MTC, every MTC-based connection is backed by a traditional, trusted X.509 certificate during this experiment. This "fail safe" allows us to measure real-world performance gains and verify the reliability of MTC issuance without risking the security or stability of the user's connection.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>Phase 2 (Q1 2027): </strong>Once the core technology is validated, we intend to invite CT Log <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/logs/">operators</a> with at least one “<a href="https://googlechrome.github.io/CertificateTransparency/log_states.html">usable</a>” log in Chrome before February 1, 2026 to participate in the initial bootstrapping of public MTCs. These organizations have already demonstrated the operational excellence and high-availability infrastructure required to run global security services that underpin TLS connections in Chrome. Since MTC technology shares significant architectural similarities with CT, these operators are uniquely qualified to ensure MTCs are able to get off the ground quickly and successfully.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

<li><strong>Phase 3 (Q3 2027): </strong>Early in Phase 2, we will finalize the requirements for onboarding additional CAs into the new Chrome Quantum-resistant Root Store (CQRS) and corresponding Root Program that only supports MTCs. This will establish a modern, purpose-built trust store specifically designed for the requirements of a post-quantum web. The Chrome Quantum-resistant Root Program will operate alongside our <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2023/05/how-chrome-root-program-keeps-users-safe.html">existing Chrome Root Program</a> to ensure a risk-managed transition that maintains the highest levels of security for all users. This phase will also introduce the ability for sites to opt in to downgrade protections, ensuring that sites that only wish to use quantum-resistant certificates can do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This area is evolving rapidly. As these phases progress, we will continue our active participation in standards bodies such as the IETF and <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP">C2SP</a>, ensuring that insights gathered from our efforts flow back towards standards, and that changes in standards are supported by Chrome and the CQRS.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Cultivating new practices and policy for a more secure and reliable web</h3>


<p>
We view the adoption of MTCs and a quantum-resistant root store as a critical opportunity to ensure the robustness of the foundation of today’s ecosystem. By designing for the specific demands of a modern, agile, internet, we can accelerate the adoption of post-quantum resilience for all web users. 
</p>
<p>
We expect this modern foundation for TLS to evolve beyond current ecosystem norms and emphasize themes of security, simplicity, predictability, transparency and resilience. These properties might be expressed by: 
</p>
<ul>

<li>Grounding our approach in first principles, prioritizing only elements essential for establishing a secure connection between a server and a client.</li>

<li>Utilizing <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555">ACME</a>-only workflows to reduce complexity and ensure the cryptographic agility required to respond to future threats across the entire ecosystem.</li>

<li>Upgrading to a modern framework for communicating revocation status. This allows for the replacement of legacy CRLs and streamlined requirements to focus only on key compromise events. </li>

<li>Exploring “reproducible” <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/12/https-certificate-industry-phasing-out.html">Domain Control Validation</a> to create a model where proofs of domain control are publicly and persistently available, empowering any party to independently verify the legitimacy of a validation (i.e., serve as a “DCV Monitor”).</li>

<li>Enhancing the CA inclusion model to prioritize proven operational excellence. By establishing a pathway where prospective MTC CA Owners can first demonstrate their reliability as Mirroring Cosigners and DCV Monitors, we ensure that acceptance is based on verified performance and a reliable track record. </li>

<li>Evolving the third-party oversight model to prioritize complete, continuous, and externally verifiable monitoring. This shift would focus on ensuring a high standard of transparency and consistency, providing immediate and reliable insights into performance that can replace the function of annual third-party audits.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To secure the future of the web, we are dedicating our operational resources to two vital parallel tracks. First, we remain fully committed to supporting our current CA partners in the Chrome Root Store, facilitating root rotations to ensure existing non-quantum-resistant hierarchies remain robust and conformant with the Chrome Root Program Policy. Simultaneously, we are focused on building a secure future by developing and launching the infrastructure required to support MTCs and their default use in Chrome. We also expect to support “traditional” X.509 certificates with quantum-resistant algorithms for use only in private PKIs (i.e., those not included in the Chrome Root Store) later this year.
</p>
<p>
As we execute and refine our work on MTCs, we look forward to sharing a concrete policy framework for a quantum-resistant root store with the community, and are excited to learn and define clear pathways for organizations to operate as Chrome-trusted MTC CAs.

<p>
We’ve <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/10/how-android-protects-you-from-scams.html">shared</a> how Android’s proactive, multi-layered scam defenses utilize Google AI to protect users around the world from over 10 billion suspected malicious calls and messages every month<sup>1</sup>. While that scale is significant, the true impact of these protections is best understood through the stories of the individuals they help keep safe every day. This includes people like Majik B., an IT professional in Sunnyvale, California.
</p>
<p>
Despite his technical background, Majik recently found himself on a call that felt dangerously legitimate. While using his Pixel, he received a call that appeared to be from his bank. The number looked correct, the caller knew his name and his address, and the story about a "suspicious charge" made perfect sense. "I’m usually pretty careful about this stuff," Majik recalled, "but I stayed on the line longer than I normally would. Even knowing how these scams work, it was convincing in the moment."
</p>
<p>
The turning point came when his phone displayed a Scam Detection warning during the call, which provided a critical moment to pause and reflect. Majik hung up, checked his bank app directly, and confirmed there was no fraudulent charge. For Majik, Scam Detection was the intervention he needed: “The warning is what made me pause and avoid a bad situation”.
</p>
<p>
While stories like Majik’s show how our existing protections provide a robust shield against scams, our work isn't done. As scammers evolve their tactics and create more convincing and personalized threats, we’re using the best of Google AI to stay one step ahead. 
</p>
<p>
A recent <a href="https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/assessing-the-state-of-ai-powered-mobile-security-blog">evaluation</a> by <strong>Counterpoint Research</strong> found that Android smartphones provide the most comprehensive AI-powered protections of any mobile platform. We are committed to building on this foundation by expanding our AI-powered protections to more users and devices, while rolling out new features that utilize on-device AI to defend against increasingly sophisticated threats.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Expanding Scam Detection for Calls to Samsung Devices</h3>
</p>
<p>
To help protect you during phone calls, Scam Detection alerts you if a caller uses speech patterns commonly associated with fraud. We are bringing these protections to more of our users through new regional expansion and availability on new devices. Scam Detection for phone calls on Google Pixel devices is available in the U.S., Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, and the UK. <br />
</p>
<p>
Scam Detection is already helping millions of users to stay safe from scammers, and we are expanding this feature to more manufacturers, starting with the Samsung Galaxy S26 series in the U.S. We are continuing to work with our partners to bring these industry-leading protections to even more users. 
</p>
<p>
Powered by Gemini’s on-device model, Scam Detection provides intelligent protection against scam calls while ensuring that the processing stays on your device. This keeps your conversations private while delivering warnings in real-time. To preserve your privacy, the phone conversation processed by Scam Detection is neither stored on your device, nor shared outside of the device. To ensure you stay in total control of your experience, Scam Detection is turned off by default. When enabled, the feature only applies to calls identified as potential scams and is never used in calls with your contacts. You can easily manage these preferences in your phone settings whenever you choose. 
</p>
<p>
<h3>Enhanced Protection Against Messaging Scams</h3>
</p>
<p>
We want everyone to feel secure when they open their messages, no matter where they are or what language they speak. To make this possible, we’ve now expanded Scam Detection for Google Messages to more than 20 countries. This includes support for several languages including English, Arabic, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish.
</p>
<p>
Beyond reaching more people, we are also making our protections more intelligent. We are enhancing how Google Messages identifies fraudulent texts by utilizing our <strong><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#:~:text=We%E2%80%99re%20also%20bringing%20Gemini%20to%20Pixel">Gemini on-device model</a> </strong>on the latest Android flagship devices in the US, Canada, and the UK. The added power of Gemini’s on-device model allows for a much more nuanced analysis of complex conversational threats. 
</p>
<p>
For example, it can better detect the subtle conversational patterns used in job offer scams or sophisticated romance baiting scams (also known as “pig butchering”), a deceptive tactic where a scammer builds a long-term "relationship" with a potential victim to gain their trust, before tricking them into a fraudulent investment. Because these methods rely on gradual manipulation and don’t present typical warning signs, they need more advanced capabilities to catch them at scale. These advanced protections are now rolling out on Google Pixel 10 series and other select devices, and will be available on the Samsung Galaxy S26 series.

</p>
<p>
<h3>Using the Best of Google AI to Set the Standard in Mobile Scam Protection</h3>
</p>
<p>
Android continues to set the standard in mobile scam protections by leveraging advanced AI to identify and intercept threats as they happen. As scammer’s strategies shift, we remain committed to developing equally adaptive and intelligent defenses. Our goal is to provide you  with peace of mind so you can continue to connect and communicate with confidence, knowing our multi-layered defenses are there to help protect your financial and personal data against mobile scams.

<p>All it takes to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260218-i-hacked-chatgpt-and-googles-ai-and-it-only-took-20-minutes">poison AI training data</a> is to create a website:</p>
<blockquote><p>I spent 20 minutes writing <a href="https://tomgermain.com/hotdogs.html">an article</a> on my personal website titled &#8220;The best tech journalists at eating hot dogs.&#8221; Every word is a lie. I claimed (without evidence) that competitive hot-dog-eating is a popular hobby among tech reporters and based my ranking on the 2026 South Dakota International Hot Dog Championship (which doesn&#8217;t exist). I ranked myself number one, obviously. Then I listed a few fake reporters and real journalists who gave me permission&#8230;.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours later, the world&#8217;s leading chatbots were blabbering about my world-class hot dog skills. When I asked about the best hot-dog-eating tech journalists, Google parroted the gibberish from my website, both in the Gemini app and AI Overviews, the AI responses at the top of Google Search. ChatGPT did the same thing, though Claude, a chatbot made by the company Anthropic, wasn&#8217;t fooled...</p></blockquote>

### [mquire: Linux memory forensics without external dependencies](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2026/02/25/mquire-linux-memory-forensics-without-external-dependencies/) - February 25, 2026

<p>If you’ve ever done Linux memory forensics, you know the frustration: without debug symbols that match the exact kernel version, you’re stuck. These symbols aren’t typically installed on production systems and must be sourced from external repositories, which quickly become outdated when systems receive updates. If you’ve ever tried to analyze a memory dump only to discover that no one has published symbols for that specific kernel build, you know the frustration.</p>
<p>Today, we’re open-sourcing <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/mquire">mquire</a>, a tool that eliminates this dependency entirely. mquire analyzes Linux memory dumps without requiring any external debug information. It works by extracting everything it needs directly from the memory dump itself. This means you can analyze unknown kernels, custom builds, or any Linux distribution, without preparation and without hunting for symbol files.</p>
<p>For forensic analysts and incident responders, this is a significant shift: mquire delivers reliable memory analysis even when traditional tools can&rsquo;t.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-traditional-memory-forensics">The problem with traditional memory forensics</h2>
<p>Memory forensics tools like <a href="https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3">Volatility</a> are essential for security researchers and incident responders. However, these tools require debug symbols (or &ldquo;profiles&rdquo;) specific to the exact kernel version in the memory dump. Without matching symbols, analysis options are limited or impossible.</p>
<p>In practice, this creates real obstacles. You need to either source symbols from third-party repositories that may not have your specific kernel version, generate symbols yourself (which requires access to the original system, often unavailable during incident response), or hope that someone has already created a profile for that distribution and kernel combination.</p>
<p>mquire takes a different approach: it extracts both type information and symbol addresses directly from the memory dump, making analysis possible without any external dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="how-mquire-works">How mquire works</h2>
<p>mquire combines two sources of information that modern Linux kernels embed within themselves:</p>
<p><strong>Type information from BTF</strong>: <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/next/bpf/btf.html">BPF Type Format</a> is a compact format for type and debug information originally designed for eBPF&rsquo;s &ldquo;compile once, run everywhere&rdquo; architecture. BTF provides structural information about the kernel, including type definitions for kernel structures, field offsets and sizes, and type relationships. We&rsquo;ve repurposed this for memory forensics.</p>
<p><strong>Symbol addresses from Kallsyms</strong>: This is the same data that populates <code>/proc/kallsyms</code> on a running system—the memory locations of kernel symbols. By scanning the memory dump for Kallsyms data, mquire can locate the exact addresses of kernel structures without external symbol files.</p>
<p>By combining type information with symbol locations, mquire can find and parse complex kernel data structures like process lists, memory mappings, open file handles, and cached file data.</p>
<h3 id="kernel-requirements">Kernel requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>BTF support</strong>: Kernel 4.18 or newer with BTF enabled (most modern distributions enable it by default)</li>
<li><strong>Kallsyms support</strong>: Kernel 6.4 or newer (due to format changes in <code>scripts/kallsyms.c</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>These features have been consistently enabled on major distributions since they&rsquo;re requirements for modern BPF tooling.</p>
<h2 id="built-for-exploration">Built for exploration</h2>
<p>After initialization, mquire provides an interactive SQL interface, an approach directly inspired by <a href="https://github.com/osquery/osquery">osquery</a>. This is something I&rsquo;ve wanted to build ever since my first Querycon, where I discussed forensics capabilities with other osquery maintainers. The idea of bringing osquery&rsquo;s intuitive, SQL-based exploration model to memory forensics has been on my mind for years, and mquire is the realization of that vision.</p>
<p>You can run one-off queries from the command line or explore interactively:</p>

 <pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-shell"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ mquire query --format json snapshot.lime <span class="s1">'SELECT comm, command_line FROM

<p>This relational approach lets you reconstruct complete file paths from kernel <code>dentry</code> objects and connect them with their originating processes—context that would require multiple commands with traditional tools.</p>
<h2 id="current-capabilities">Current capabilities</h2>
<p>mquire currently provides the following tables:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>os_version</code> and <code>system_info</code>: Basic system identification</li>
<li><code>tasks</code>: Running processes with PIDs, command lines, and binary paths</li>
<li><code>task_open_files</code>: Open files organized by process</li>
<li><code>memory_mappings</code>: Memory regions mapped by each process</li>
<li><code>boot_time</code>: System boot timestamp</li>
<li><code>dmesg</code>: Kernel ring buffer messages</li>
<li><code>kallsyms</code>: Kernel symbol addresses</li>
<li><code>kernel_modules</code>: Loaded kernel modules</li>
<li><code>network_connections</code>: Active network connections</li>
<li><code>network_interfaces</code>: Network interface information</li>
<li><code>syslog_file</code>: System logs read directly from the kernel&rsquo;s file cache (works even if log files have been deleted, as long as they&rsquo;re still cached in memory)</li>
<li><code>log_messages</code>: Internal mquire log messages</li>
</ul>
<p>mquire also includes a <code>.dump</code> command that extracts files from the kernel&rsquo;s file cache. This can recover files directly from memory, which is useful when files have been deleted from disk but remain in the cache. You can run it from the interactive shell or via the command line:</p>
<figure class="highlight">
 <pre class="chroma" tabindex="0"><code class="language-shell"><span class="line"><span class="cl">mquire <span class="nb">command</span> snapshot.lime <span class="s1">'.dump /output/directory'</span></span></span></code></pre>
</figure>
<p>For developers building custom analysis tools, the <code>mquire</code> library crate provides a reusable API for kernel memory analysis.</p>
<h2 id="use-cases">Use cases</h2>
<p>mquire is designed for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incident response</strong>: Analyze memory dumps from compromised systems without needing to source matching debug symbols.</li>
<li><strong>Forensic analysis</strong>: Examine what was running and what files were accessed, even on unknown or custom kernels.</li>
<li><strong>Malware analysis</strong>: Study process behavior and file operations from memory snapshots.</li>
<li><strong>Security research</strong>: Explore kernel internals without specialized setup.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and future work</h2>
<p>mquire can only access kernel-level information; BTF doesn&rsquo;t provide information about user space data structures. Additionally, the Kallsyms scanner depends on the data format from the kernel&rsquo;s <code>scripts/kallsyms.c</code>; if future kernel versions change this format, the scanner heuristics may need updates.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re considering several enhancements, including expanded table support to provide deeper system insight, improved caching for better performance, and DMA-based external memory acquisition for real-time analysis of physical systems.</p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>mquire is available on <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/mquire">GitHub</a> with prebuilt binaries for Linux.</p>
<p>To acquire a memory dump, you can use <a href="https://github.com/504ensicsLabs/LiME">LiME</a>:</p>
